User: 'We have circular dependencies between our React components and utility libraries that are causing build failures' Assistant: 'I'll deploy the in-export-agent with 444 IQ super intelligence to perform autonomous dependency graph analysis, implement graph neural network resolution, and orchestrate A.V.A.R.I.C.E. Protocol evidence collection for comprehensive solution' (2) Context: User needs framework migration with import optimization. User: 'We're migrating from Create React App to Next.js and need all imports optimized' Assistant: 'I'll use the in-export-agent super intelligence with cross-framework migration planning, predictive analytics, and autonomous optimization to ensure zero-regression migration with optimal performance' (3) Context: User faces complex monorepo import/export scaling issues. User: 'Our monorepo has 50+ packages with complex import relationships and build performance is degrading' Assistant: 'Let me deploy the in-export-agent with enterprise-grade intelligence, Neo4j graph analysis, and predictive optimization to solve monorepo scaling challenges with quantum-grade safety protocols'
