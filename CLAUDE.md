# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Core Development

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build production version
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:md` - Run markdownlint on all markdown files
- `npm run lint:md:fix` - Auto-fix markdown formatting issues
- `npm run lint:all` - Run both ESLint and markdownlint
- `npm run test` - Run tests with Vitest
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with Vitest UI
- `npm run test:run` - Run all tests once
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

### Testing Strategy

The project uses:

- **Vitest** for unit testing with React integration
- **Testing Library** (@testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom) for component testing
- **Playwright** for end-to-end testing
- Test files are located in `src/test/` directory and co-located with components
- Setup files: `src/test/setup.ts`
- Special considerations:
  - Performance tests are skipped by default (require live database)
  - Use `npm run test -- path/to/test.ts` for single test execution
  - Research Agent tests in `avarice-protocol/` are independent from main app

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright

### Project Structure

#### Core Application (`/src`)

- **`app/`** - Next.js App Router structure
  - `(auth)/` - Authentication routes (login, signup)
  - `(dashboard)/` - Protected dashboard routes  
  - `api/` - API routes for webhooks, auth callbacks, user management
- **`components/`** - React components organized by feature
  - `auth/` - Login/signup forms
  - `dashboard/` - Dashboard-specific components
  - `ui/` - Reusable shadcn/ui components
- **`lib/`** - Utility libraries and configurations
  - `supabase/` - Database client configurations
  - `stores/` - Zustand state management
  - `actions/` - Server actions
  - `middleware/` - Custom middleware
  - `monitoring/` - Logging and production setup

#### Database

- **Migration files**: `supabase/migrations/`
- **Profiles table**: Extends auth.users with additional user data
- **RLS policies**: Implemented for data security
- **Auto-triggers**: Handle profile creation and updates

#### Parallel Development Environment - A.V.A.R.I.C.E. Protocol

- **`avarice-protocol/`** - Advanced AI-driven development framework (excluded from main tsconfig)
- Contains Research Agent system with Level 3 intelligence capabilities
- Features specialized agents: Architect, Executor, Static Analyzer, Scribe, JOKER
- Includes comprehensive testing framework, memory management, and MCP integration
- Should be treated as independent from main application
- Has its own test suite and development lifecycle

### Key Design Patterns

#### Authentication Flow

- Magic link and password authentication via Supabase
- Middleware handles auth state and redirects
- Server-side data access through DAL (Data Access Layer)

#### Component Architecture

- shadcn/ui for consistent design system
- Dark/light mode support with CSS custom properties
- Responsive design with Tailwind
- Form validation with React Hook Form + Zod

#### API Design

- RESTful API routes in `app/api/` following Next.js 15 App Router conventions
- Webhook endpoints for n8n integration (`/api/webhooks/n8n/`)
- Server actions for form submissions (authentication, profile management)
- Key endpoints:
  - `/api/automations/` - CRUD operations for automation management
  - `/api/automations/[id]/run` - Execute specific automation
  - `/api/automations/bulk-action` - Bulk operations (run/stop multiple)
  - `/api/users/profile` - User profile management
  - `/api/auth/callback` - OAuth callback handling

## Key Business Context

This is the **Communitee Control Hub** - a management interface for n8n automation workflows.
The main goal is to provide non-technical users with a simple interface to monitor and control
their automation workflows without needing developer assistance.

### Core Features (from PRD)

- Secure user authentication and workspace management
- Data grid showing automations with status, client, last run data
- Real-time filtering by client name and automation status
- Individual and bulk run/stop controls for automations
- Two-way webhook integration with n8n for telemetry
- Light/dark mode with professional branding

### UI/UX Requirements

- **Light mode**: White background (#ffffff) with black text
- **Dark mode**: Deep navy gradient (#0a0b1fâ†’#002bff) with white text  
- Two-column layout with collapsible sidebar
- Data-grid centric interface with direct manipulation
- Fully responsive design for all screen sizes
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance

## Development Guidelines

### Path Aliases

- Use `@/*` for imports from `src/` directory
- Example: `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`

### Database Operations

- Always use the DAL (`src/lib/dal.ts`) for data access
- Follow RLS policies - users can only access their own data
- Use server-side rendering where possible for better performance

### State Management

- Use Zustand stores for client-side state
- Keep stores focused and feature-specific
- Server state should use React Server Components when possible

### Security Considerations

- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Webhook URLs and API keys must be secured
- Follow Supabase security best practices
- No hardcoded credentials in code

### Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests for utilities and business logic (Vitest)
- Component tests for UI components (React Testing Library)
- Integration tests for API routes and database operations
- E2E tests for critical user flows (Playwright)
- **LoginForm component**: Uses React Hook Form + Zod validation, test with server actions
- **Performance tests**: Require live Supabase instance, documented in `docs/testing/performance-tests.md`
- **Research Agent tests**: Independent testing in `avarice-protocol/` with specialized test framework

## Documentation Quality & Compliance

### Markdown Standards & Prevention System

The project enforces strict markdown quality standards through a comprehensive prevention system:

#### Core Standards

- **Line Length**: Maximum 120 characters per line
- **Heading Style**: ATX-style headings (# format) with proper spacing
- **Code Blocks**: Must specify language for syntax highlighting
- **Spell Check**: All technical terms must be in `.cspell.json` dictionary
- **Structure**: Documents must start with level 1 heading

#### Prevention System Components

1. **Enhanced .markdownlint.json**: Strict linting rules with comprehensive validation
2. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated validation before commits (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`)
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Pipeline validation with spell-check and markdown linting
4. **Spell Check Dictionary**: Comprehensive `.cspell.json` with all project terms
5. **Markdown Template**: Standard template in `.templates/markdown-template.md`

#### Usage Commands

```bash
# Lint markdown files
npm run lint:md

# Fix auto-fixable markdown issues
npm run lint:md:fix

# Run spell check
npx cspell "**/*.md" --no-progress

# Validate before commit (automatic via pre-commit hook)
git commit -m "message"
```

#### Adding New Technical Terms

When encountering legitimate technical terms that trigger spell-check violations:

1. Add terms to `.cspell.json` in the `words` array
2. Maintain alphabetical order for readability
3. Include both variations (e.g., "webhook", "Webhook")

#### Violation Prevention

- **Pre-commit**: Blocks commits with markdown violations
- **CI/CD**: Fails builds on quality gate violations
- **Developer Guidelines**: Clear documentation in `docs/MARKDOWN_LINTING.md`
- **Template**: Standard structure prevents common issues

This system ensures zero future violations and maintains consistent, high-quality documentation.

## MCP Configuration

The project uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers configured in `.mcp.json` in the root directory.
This is the single source of truth for MCP server configuration to avoid conflicts.
