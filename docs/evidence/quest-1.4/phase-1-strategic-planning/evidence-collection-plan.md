# Evidence Collection Plan - Quest 1.4: Database Schema & Read-Only UI Grid

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive evidence collection strategy for all deliverables across all 9 phases of Quest 1.4 execution, ensuring complete auditability and verification of all A.V.A.R.I.C.E. Protocol activities.

## Evidence Collection Principles

### Concrete Evidence Requirements
- **Actual Execution**: All evidence must demonstrate actual execution, not theoretical frameworks
- **Verifiable Artifacts**: All claims backed by concrete, measurable evidence
- **Timestamped Documentation**: All evidence includes timestamps for audit trails
- **Complete Coverage**: Evidence collected for every deliverable and quality gate
