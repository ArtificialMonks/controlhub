## Opening Statements (15 minutes)

### Database Architecture Expert

**Position**: "The current schema mismatch with Architecture Document is critical. We need migration 006 to align
exactly with specifications."

**Key Points**:

- Existing automations table has incompatible structure (workflow_type vs status enum)
- Architecture Document requires specific status values: 'Running', 'Stopped', 'Error', 'Stalled'
- RLS performance optimization essential - research shows 2-11x degradation without proper indexing
- Real-time subscriptions require careful policy design

**Research Evidence**: Context7 MCP analysis shows RLS optimization patterns can achieve 100x performance improvement
with proper indexing.

### UI/UX Architecture Expert

**Position**: "shadcn/ui Table component with TanStack Table integration provides optimal solution for accessibility and
functionality."

**Key Points**:

- Component composition pattern ensures maximum flexibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achievable with proper semantic HTML
- TypeScript integration essential for type safety
- Responsive design critical for non-technical users

**Research Evidence**: React documentation emphasizes component composition and accessibility patterns. External
research confirms shadcn/ui + TanStack Table as industry standard.

### Security Expert

**Position**: "RLS policies must balance security with performance. Client-based access control is non-negotiable."

**Key Points**:

- RLS policies should use (SELECT auth.uid()) pattern for caching
- Explicit filtering in addition to RLS for performance
- JWT integration must be secure and performant
- Audit trails required for all data access

**Research Evidence**: Supabase documentation shows security definer functions can bypass RLS for performance while
maintaining security.

### Performance Expert

**Position**: "Performance optimization must be built-in from the start, not retrofitted."

**Key Points**:

- Database indexing on client_id column mandatory
- Component rendering optimization with React.memo and useMemo
- Real-time subscription efficiency critical for scalability
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

**Research Evidence**: Performance research shows proper indexing and function wrapping can eliminate RLS performance
penalties.

### Quality Assurance Expert

**Position**: "Comprehensive testing strategy with accessibility validation is essential for production readiness."

**Key Points**:

- jest-axe integration for automated accessibility testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- TypeScript strict mode for compile-time validation
- Integration testing for database and UI components

**Research Evidence**: Industry best practices emphasize accessibility testing automation and comprehensive type safety.

### Integration Expert

**Position**: "Seamless integration with existing dashboard architecture is critical for user experience continuity."

**Key Points**:

- Next.js App Router compatibility essential
- Existing component patterns must be maintained
- Supabase client integration optimization
- Progressive enhancement approach for new features

**Research Evidence**: React documentation emphasizes component integration patterns and backward compatibility.

## Research Presentation (20 minutes)

### Database Architecture Expert - Research Findings

**RLS Performance Optimization**:

```sql
-- Optimized RLS policy with function wrapping
CREATE POLICY "client_automations_select" ON automations
FOR SELECT USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) IN (
  SELECT user_id FROM profiles WHERE client_id = automations.client_id
));

-- Essential index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_automations_client_id ON automations(client_id);

```text
**Migration Strategy**:

- Drop and recreate approach for schema alignment
- Backup existing data before migration
- Comprehensive seed data for testing
- RLS policies optimized for performance

### UI/UX Architecture Expert - Research Findings

**Component Architecture**:

```typescript
// Optimal component structure
interface AutomationTableRow {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  client: string;
  status: AutomationStatus;
  lastRun: string | null;
  avgDuration: string | null;
  successRate: string;
}

// TanStack Table integration
const table = useReactTable({
  data,
  columns,
  getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
  getSortedRowModel: getSortedRowModel(),
  getFilteredRowModel: getFilteredRowModel(),
});

```text
**Accessibility Requirements**:

- Proper table headers with scope attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance (4.5:1 minimum)

## Collaborative Discussion (30 minutes)

### Debate Topic 1: Database Migration Strategy

**Database Expert**: "We must align exactly with Architecture Document. The current schema is incompatible."

**Integration Expert**: "Agreed, but we need to ensure backward compatibility during transition."

**Security Expert**: "Migration must preserve existing RLS policies and audit trails."

**Performance Expert**: "New schema should include performance optimizations from the start."

**CONSENSUS REACHED**: Execute migration 006 with exact Architecture Document alignment, including backup strategy and
performance optimizations.

### Debate Topic 2: UI Component Architecture

**UI/UX Expert**: "shadcn/ui Table with TanStack Table provides best balance of functionality and accessibility."

**Quality Expert**: "Component must include comprehensive testing from day one."

**Performance Expert**: "Virtualization may be needed for large datasets in the future."

**Integration Expert**: "Component styling must match existing dashboard patterns."

**CONSENSUS REACHED**: Implement shadcn/ui Table component with TanStack Table integration, comprehensive testing, and
dashboard styling consistency.

### Debate Topic 3: Accessibility Implementation

**UI/UX Expert**: "WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is mandatory, not optional."

**Quality Expert**: "Automated testing with jest-axe plus manual validation required."

**Security Expert**: "Accessibility features must not compromise security."

**Performance Expert**: "Accessibility enhancements should not impact performance."

**CONSENSUS REACHED**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with automated and manual testing, security-conscious implementation.

### Debate Topic 4: Performance Optimization

**Performance Expert**: "RLS optimization and component performance must be addressed together."

**Database Expert**: "Proper indexing and query optimization are foundational."

**UI/UX Expert**: "Component rendering optimization with React best practices."

**Integration Expert**: "Performance monitoring and metrics collection essential."

**CONSENSUS REACHED**: Comprehensive performance optimization strategy covering database, component rendering, and
monitoring.
