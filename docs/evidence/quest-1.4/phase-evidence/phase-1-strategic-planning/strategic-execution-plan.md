# Strategic Execution Plan - Quest 1.4: Database Schema & Read-Only UI Grid

## Executive Summary

**Quest Objective**: Implement database schema and read-only UI grid component that exactly matches Architecture Document specifications with full functionality and comprehensive testing.

### Phase 4: Implementation
**Objective**: Execute actual code implementation
**Duration**: 90-120 minutes
**Key Deliverables**:
- Execute database migration 006
- Create AutomationsDataTable component
- Integrate component with dashboard
- Implement comprehensive testing

### Phase 5-9: Verification, Review, Validation, Memorization, Termination
**Objective**: Complete validation and autonomous termination
**Duration**: 240-300 minutes total
**Focus**: Quality assurance, compliance validation, knowledge memorization
