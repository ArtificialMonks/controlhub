# Memorization Directory

## Overview

This directory contains Neo4j memory storage confirmations and institutional memory artifacts for long-term
knowledge preservation.

## Memory Storage Categories

### Knowledge Graph Storage (`knowledge-graph-storage/`)

**Purpose**: Neo4j knowledge graph storage and validation

Subdirectories:

- `data-model-validation/`: Neo4j data model validation results
- `cypher-queries/`: Cypher queries for data ingestion and retrieval
- `storage-confirmations/`: Proof of successful Neo4j storage operations

**Neo4j Integration Tools**:

- `validate_data_model_neo4j`: Validate complete data model
- `validate_node_neo4j`: Validate individual nodes
- `validate_relationship_neo4j`: Validate relationships
- `export_to_arrows_json_neo4j`: Export for Arrows.app visualization
- `get_mermaid_config_str_neo4j`: Generate Mermaid diagrams

### Memory Handoff Logs (`memory-handoff-logs/`)

**Purpose**: Phase transition and agent handoff documentation

Subdirectories:

- `phase-transitions/`: Memory handoffs between protocol phases
- `agent-handoffs/`: Memory transfers between agents
- `context-preservation/`: Context continuity validation

**Memory Handoff Requirements**:

- Complete context transfer documentation
- Agent memory state preservation
- Phase transition continuity validation
- Knowledge graph updates and confirmations

### Institutional Memory (`institutional-memory/`)

**Purpose**: Long-term organizational knowledge preservation

Subdirectories:

- `organizational-knowledge/`: Enterprise knowledge capture
- `pattern-recognition/`: Historical pattern documentation
- `lessons-learned/`: Quest learnings and improvements

## Memory Architecture

### 6-Layer Memory System

1. **Core Memory**: Essential quest data and outcomes (365 days retention)
2. **Episodic Memory**: Specific quest episodes and experiences (90 days retention)
3. **Semantic Memory**: Conceptual knowledge and patterns (365 days retention)
4. **Procedural Memory**: Process knowledge and execution patterns (365 days retention)
5. **Resource Memory**: Tool usage and resource allocation (60-90 days retention)
6. **Knowledge Vault**: Critical institutional knowledge (730 days retention)

- Knowledge Vault: 365 days
- Procedural Memory: 180 days

#### Scribe Agent

- All 6 memory types
- Institutional storage mandate: 365-730 days

## Neo4j Data Models

### Quest Node Structure

```cypher
CREATE (quest:Quest {
  questId: $questId,
  name: $name,
  status: $status,
  phase: $phase,
  domain: $domain,
  complexity: $complexity,
  requirements: $requirements,
  createdAt: $createdAt,
  updatedAt: $updatedAt
})
```

### Knowledge Item Structure

```cypher
CREATE (knowledge:KnowledgeItem {
  itemId: $itemId,
  questId: $questId,
  category: $category,
  content: $content,
  confidence: $confidence,
  source: $source,
  createdAt: $createdAt,
  retentionPolicy: $retentionPolicy
})
```

### Memory Layer Structure

```cypher
CREATE (layer:MemoryLayer {
  layerId: $layerId,
  layerType: $layerType,
  retentionDays: $retentionDays,
  agentId: $agentId,
  questId: $questId,
  createdAt: $createdAt
})
```

## Storage Validation

### Validation Requirements

- All Neo4j operations must be validated using MCP tools
- All data models must pass validation before storage
- All relationships must be verified for integrity
- All memory handoffs must be confirmed with evidence

### Evidence Requirements

- Neo4j storage confirmation screenshots
- Cypher query execution logs
- Data model validation results
- Memory handoff documentation
- Institutional memory transfer evidence

### Audit Trail

- Complete audit trail of all memory operations
- Timestamped evidence of all storage activities
- Verification of memory retention policies
- Validation of knowledge graph integrity

## Integration Points

### A.V.A.R.I.C.E. Protocol Integration

- Memory storage integrated with all 9 phases
- Agent memory patterns enforced throughout protocol
- Knowledge graph updated continuously
- Institutional memory preserved across quests

### Cross-Quest Continuity

- Knowledge transfer between quests
- Pattern recognition across multiple quests
- Institutional learning preservation
- Historical context maintenance
