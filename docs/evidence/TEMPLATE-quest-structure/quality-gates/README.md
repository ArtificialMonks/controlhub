# Quality Gates Directory

## Overview

This directory contains quality gate validation results and compliance evidence for all A.V.A.R.I.C.E. Protocol
quality standards.

## Quality Gate Categories

### TypeScript Validation (`typescript-validation/`)

**Enforcement**: Zero tolerance for TypeScript compilation errors

Subdirectories:

- `compilation-results/`: TypeScript compilation logs and results
- `type-checking/`: Type checking validation and error resolution
- `strict-mode-compliance/`: Strict mode compliance verification

**Validation Commands**:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit --strict

```text
**Success Criteria**:

- Zero compilation errors
- Zero type checking warnings
- 100% strict mode compliance

### ESLint Compliance (`eslint-compliance/`)

**Enforcement**: Zero tolerance for ESLint violations

Subdirectories:

- `linting-results/`: ESLint execution results and metrics
- `code-quality/`: Code quality assessments and improvements
- `style-compliance/`: Code style compliance verification

**Validation Commands**:

```bash
npx eslint src --ext .ts --max-warnings 0

```text
**Success Criteria**:

- Zero ESLint errors
- Zero ESLint warnings
- 100% code style compliance

### Test Execution (`test-execution/`)

**Enforcement**: All tests must pass with documented coverage

Subdirectories:

- `unit-tests/`: Unit test execution results and coverage
- `integration-tests/`: Integration test results and validation
- `e2e-tests/`: End-to-end test execution and evidence

**Validation Commands**:

```bash
pnpm run test
pnpm run test:coverage
pnpm run test:e2e

```text
**Success Criteria**:

- 100% test pass rate
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- All E2E scenarios validated

### Security Validation (`security-validation/`)

**Enforcement**: Zero security vulnerabilities allowed

Subdirectories:

- `vulnerability-scans/`: Security vulnerability scan results
- `security-assessments/`: Security assessment reports
- `compliance-checks/`: Security compliance verification

**Validation Areas**:

- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security analysis
- Authentication and authorization validation
- Data protection compliance

## Quality Gate Enforcement

### A.V.A.R.I.C.E. Protocol Compliance

- **ZERO TOLERANCE QUALITY GATE**: 100% completion requirement
- **IMMEDIATE ISSUE RESOLUTION**: Stop-work order for any quality violations
- **EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT**: Concrete proof of all quality validations
- **CONTINUOUS VALIDATION**: Quality gates enforced throughout all phases

### Prevention Rules Integration

Reference: `.augment/rules/prevention-quality-rules.md`

- Evidence documentation: Complete and verifiable

## Validation Workflow

### Pre-Phase Validation

1. Run all quality gate validations
2. Document results in appropriate subdirectories
3. Resolve any violations before proceeding
4. Store evidence artifacts with timestamps

### Post-Phase Validation

1. Re-run all quality gate validations
2. Verify no regressions introduced
3. Document validation results
4. Update quality metrics dashboard

### Continuous Monitoring

- Automated quality gate execution
- Real-time violation detection
- Immediate notification of failures
- Audit trail maintenance
