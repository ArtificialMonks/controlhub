# Quality Gates Framework - A.V.A.R.I.C.E. Protocol

## Overview

Comprehensive quality gates framework for Quest 1.2 (User Authentication Setup) ensuring zero-tolerance quality
standards across all 9 phases of execution.

## Core Quality Principles

### A.V.A.R.I.C.E. Protocol Compliance

- **MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOLS**: All activities must be ACTUALLY EXECUTED with concrete evidence
- **PRE-CREATION CODEBASE SCANNING**: Comprehensive codebase analysis before any creation
- **EVIDENCE COLLECTION**: Concrete proof including logs, metrics, screenshots, artifacts
- **ZERO ISOLATION POLICY**: All components properly connected with no orphaned modules
- **IMMEDIATE ISSUE RESOLUTION**: Stop-work order when ANY issue detected until resolved

### Prevention Quality Rules Integration

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Zero compilation errors, zero warnings
- **Interface Consistency**: 100% standardized interfaces across all components
- **Null Safety Coverage**: 95%+ property accesses with null checks
- **Configuration Compliance**: 100% configuration objects follow standards
- **Error Handling**: 100% proper type guards implemented
