#### 3. Task Breakdown Structure
**Tool:** TodoWrite system

- Focus on 3 missing settings categories
- Integration with existing 85% implementation

#### 4. Current State Analysis
**Analysis Results:**
- ✅ 85% Implementation Complete (User Profile, Appearance, Security/Privacy)
- ❌ 15% Missing (Notification, Integration, Automation Settings)
- ✅ Foundation infrastructure ready (Context, Components, Services)
- ✅ Design system patterns established

## Strategic Planning Validation

### Architecture Assessment

**✅ Existing Foundation (Reusable):**
- SettingsContext with extensible architecture
- SettingsSection compound component pattern  
- SettingsFormControls (TextInput, Switch, Select, Slider)
- Settings service layer with Supabase integration
- Complete TypeScript interfaces already defined

**✅ Implementation Strategy:**
- Extend existing patterns rather than rebuild
- Maintain visual consistency with current sections
- Leverage established security and validation patterns
- Follow existing save/reset functionality approach

### Task Priority Matrix

| Priority | Task Category | Effort | Agent Assignment |
|----------|---------------|---------|------------------|
| **P1** | Context Extension | 2 hours | EXECUTOR |
| **P1** | Notification Settings UI | 3 hours | EXECUTOR + JOKER |
| **P1** | Integration Settings UI | 4 hours | EXECUTOR + ARCHITECT |
| **P1** | Automation Settings UI | 3 hours | EXECUTOR + SCRIBE |
| **P2** | Custom Components | 7 hours | EXECUTOR + All |
| **P3** | Testing & QA | 6 hours | STATIC ANALYZER + JOKER |

**Total Estimated Effort:** 25 hours (refined from original 33 hours)
