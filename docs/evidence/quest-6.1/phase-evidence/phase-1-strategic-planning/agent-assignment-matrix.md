## Agent Coordination Protocol

### Parallel Execution Strategy

**Phase 4 - Implementation (Parallel Tracks):**
- Track A: EXECUTOR + ARCHITECT (Core implementation)
- Track B: SCRIBE + JOKER (Documentation and quality)
- Track C: STATIC ANALYZER (Continuous validation)

**Phase 5 - Verification (Convergence):**
- All agents collaborate on testing and validation
- STATIC ANALYZER leads testing coordination
- JOKER performs final quality assessments

**Phase 6-9 - Completion (Sequential):**
- SCRIBE leads documentation completion
- JOKER performs final UX validation
- ARCHITECT validates architectural compliance

### Communication Protocols

1. **Daily Sync Points:** Each agent reports progress and blockers
2. **Quality Gates:** STATIC ANALYZER validates before phase transitions
3. **Evidence Collection:** SCRIBE maintains real-time documentation
4. **Integration Points:** EXECUTOR coordinates with ARCHITECT on design decisions

## Specialized Component Assignments
