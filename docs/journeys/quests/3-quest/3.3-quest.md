\# Quest 3.3: Full Responsiveness

\#\# Status: Approved

\#\# Quest

\* As a user,  
\* I want the application to be fully usable on any device,  
\* so that I can monitor my automations from my desktop, tablet, or phone.

\#\# Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1\.  All layouts, fonts, and controls gracefully adapt to different screen sizes without breaking or causing horizontal overflow.  
2\.  On desktop and tablet screens (\>= 768px), the main content is the full data grid with all its columns.  
3\.  On mobile screens (\< 768px), the data grid transforms into a single-column list of "cards". Each card represents one automation and displays its most critical information (e.g., Name, Client, Status) and its action buttons.  
4\.  On mobile screens, the toolbar's filter controls adapt to a mobile-friendly layout, for example, by collapsing into a single "Filters" button that opens a modal or drawer.

\#\# Tasks / Subtasks

\- \[ \] Create a new \`AutomationCard\` component in the \`/src/components/features/automations-data-table/\` directory.  
\- \[ \] The \`AutomationCard\` should be designed for mobile and display the most critical automation info: Name, Client, Status, and action buttons.  
\- \[ \] In the main dashboard page, use Tailwind CSS's responsive variants (e.g., \`md:hidden\`, \`hidden md:block\`) to conditionally render either the \`AutomationsDataTable\` or a list of the new \`AutomationCard\` components based on the screen width. The breakpoint is \`768px\`.  
\- \[ \] Create a mobile-friendly version of the \`AutomationsToolbar\`. The filter controls should be hidden behind a single "Filters" button.  
\- \[ \] Clicking the mobile "Filters" button should open a \`shadcn/ui\` \`Sheet\` (drawer) or \`Dialog\` (modal) containing the search, client, and status filter controls.  
\- \[ \] Implement the responsive logic for the toolbar to switch between the desktop and mobile versions at the \`768px\` breakpoint.

\#\# Dev Notes

\* \*\*Prerequisite:\*\* This quest requires that Quest 2.1 (Toolbar UI) and Quest 1.4 (Data Grid UI) are complete.  
\* \*\*Architecture:\*\* The primary architectural pattern here is responsive design. The goal is to reuse as much state and logic as possible while providing a completely tailored view for mobile. The grid-to-card transformation is a key requirement.  
\* \*\*UI:\*\* The \`AutomationCard\` should be designed to be easily tappable, with large touch targets for the action buttons, adhering to the 44x44px minimum target size from the UI/UX Spec.

\#\# Testing

This quest requires \*\*End-to-End (E2E) Tests\*\* using Playwright's viewport sizing features.

\* \*\*Test Cases:\*\*  
    \* A test that sets the viewport to a mobile width (e.g., 390px) and verifies that the list of cards is rendered instead of the data table.  
    \* A test that verifies the mobile "Filters" button is present and that clicking it opens the filter drawer.  
    \* A test that sets the viewport to a desktop width (e.g., 1280px) and verifies the full data table is rendered.

\#\# Manual Test Steps  
1\.  Open the application on a desktop browser and verify the data grid is displayed.  
2\.  Open your browser's developer tools and switch to the responsive device toolbar.  
3\.  Set the viewport width to a mobile size (e.g., 390px).  
4\.  Verify that the view smoothly transitions from the data table to a vertical list of cards.  
5\.  Verify that the main toolbar collapses into a single "Filters" button.  
6\.  Interact with the mobile view to ensure all core functionality (opening filters, running/stopping an automation from a card) is usable and intuitive.
