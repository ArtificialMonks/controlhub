\# Quest 3.2: Implement Collapsible Sidebar

\#\# Status: Approved

\#\# Quest

\* As a user,  
\* I want to expand or collapse the main navigation sidebar,  
\* so that I can maximize my screen space for the data grid.

\#\# Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1\.  The left sidebar can be toggled between an expanded state (showing icons and text) and a collapsed state (showing only icons).  
2\.  The main content area correctly resizes to fill the available space when the sidebar's state changes.  
3\.  The expand/collapse transition is smooth, using a subtle animation.  
4\.  On desktop screens (\> 1024px), the sidebar is expanded by default.  
5\.  On tablet screens (\<= 1024px), the sidebar is collapsed by default.  
6\.  The user's preference for the sidebar's state (expanded or collapsed) is saved and remembered on that device for subsequent visits.

\#\# Tasks / Subtasks

\- \[ \] Create a \`Sidebar\` component in \`/src/components/shared/sidebar/\`.  
\- \[ \] Populate the sidebar with the MVP navigation links ("Automations", "Settings"), using \`shadcn/ui\` buttons and \`lucide-react\` icons.  
\- \[ \] Implement the state management for the sidebar's \`isCollapsed\` state in a global UI store (e.g., Zustand).  
\- \[ \] Add a toggle button to the sidebar to update the \`isCollapsed\` state.  
\- \[ \] Use CSS classes to dynamically change the sidebar's width and hide/show the text labels based on the \`isCollapsed\` state.  
\- \[ \] Implement logic to set the initial collapsed state based on the screen width.  
\- \[ \] Implement the logic to save the user's preference to local storage and retrieve it on page load.

\#\# Dev Notes

\* \*\*Prerequisite:\*\* This quest assumes Journey 1 is complete, as a basic page layout is required to place the sidebar in.  
\* \*\*Architecture:\*\* The sidebar's collapsed/expanded state is a piece of global UI state and should be managed in a global store (e.g., \`useUIStore\`). This allows the main content area to easily react to changes in the sidebar's width.  
\* \*\*UI:\*\* The transition between the expanded and collapsed states must be smooth, using a CSS transition on the \`width\` property as defined in the UI/UX Spec. The icons must always be visible in both states.

\#\# Testing

This quest requires both \*\*Component\*\* and \*\*End-to-End (E2E) Tests\*\*.

\* \*\*Component Tests (Vitest):\*\*  
    \* Test the \`Sidebar\` component to ensure it renders correctly in both collapsed and expanded states.  
    \* Test that clicking the toggle button correctly updates the state.  
\* \*\*E2E Tests (Playwright):\*\*  
    \* A test case to verify the sidebar's default state on different viewport sizes.  
    \* A test case that toggles the sidebar, reloads the page, and confirms the new state is persisted.

\#\# Manual Test Steps  
1\.  Load the application on a desktop screen (\> 1024px). The sidebar should be expanded by default.  
2\.  Click the collapse button. The sidebar should smoothly animate to its collapsed, icon-only state.  
3\.  Refresh the page. The sidebar should remain collapsed.  
4\.  Expand the sidebar again. Resize your browser window to a tablet size (\< 1024px). The sidebar should automatically collapse.  
5\.  Clear your local storage and reload on a tablet-sized window. The sidebar should be collapsed by default.
