\# Quest 3.1: Theme Implementation

\#\# Status: Approved

\#\# Quest

\* As a user,  
\* I want to switch between a light and dark theme,  
\* so that I can use the application comfortably in different lighting conditions.

\#\# Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1\.  A theme toggle is available in the user menu that switches the entire application's color scheme between the defined light and dark modes.  
2\.  All UI components (buttons, grids, sidebars, etc.) correctly adapt their styles to the selected theme.  
3\.  The theme change is applied instantly without a page reload.  
4\.  On a user's first visit, the application defaults to their operating system's theme preference (light or dark).  
5\.  The user's subsequent theme selection is persisted in the browser and applied on all future visits.

\#\# Tasks / Subtasks

\- \[ \] Configure the Next.js application for theming, following the official \`shadcn/ui\` documentation (typically using \`next-themes\`).  
\- \[ \] Define the color palettes for both "light" and "dark" themes in the global CSS file using CSS variables, adhering to the hex codes in the Style Guide.  
\- \[ \] Create a \`ThemeToggle\` component (e.g., a button with sun/moon icons) and place it in the user menu area of the main layout.  
\- \[ \] Implement the logic to detect the user's OS preference on their first visit and set the theme accordingly.  
\- \[ \] Implement the \`onClick\` handler for the toggle to switch the theme.  
\- \[ \] Implement the logic to save the user's theme preference to the browser's local storage and retrieve it on subsequent page loads.

\#\# Dev Notes

\* \*\*Prerequisite:\*\* This quest assumes Journey 1 is complete, as a basic layout with a user menu area is required to place the toggle.  
\* \*\*Architecture:\*\* Theming must be implemented using CSS variables, as is standard practice with Tailwind CSS and \`shadcn/ui\`. This ensures all components, including future ones, automatically adapt to the selected theme.  
\* \*\*UI:\*\* Refer to the \`Branding & Style Guide\` in the UI/UX Specification for the exact color values. The transition between themes should be instant and flicker-free.

\#\# Testing

This quest requires both \*\*Component\*\* and \*\*End-to-End (E2E) Tests\*\*.

\* \*\*Component Tests (Vitest):\*\*  
    \* Test the \`ThemeToggle\` component to ensure it correctly calls the theme-switching logic on click.  
\* \*\*E2E Tests (Playwright):\*\*  
    \* A test case to verify the application loads the correct default theme based on the browser's OS preference setting.  
    \* A test case that clicks the toggle, verifies the theme changes (e.g., by checking the \`class\` on the \`\<html\>\` element), reloads the page, and confirms the selected theme is persisted.

\#\# Manual Test Steps  
1\.  Open the application for the first time. Verify it defaults to your operating system's current theme.  
2\.  Use the theme toggle in the user menu. Verify all components on the page update their colors instantly to the other theme.  
3\.  Refresh the page. The application should load with the theme you selected, not the OS default.  
4\.  Manually clear your browser's local storage for the site and refresh again. The application should now revert to your OS default theme.
