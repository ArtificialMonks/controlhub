# Quest 3.1: Theme Implementation

## Status: Approved

## Quest

\* As a user,  
\* I want to switch between a light and dark theme,  
\* so that I can use the application comfortably in different lighting conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1\.  A theme toggle is available in the user menu that switches the entire

```text
 application's color scheme between the defined light and dark modes.

```text

2\.  All UI components (buttons, grids, sidebars, etc.) correctly adapt

```text
 their styles to the selected theme.

```text

3\.  The theme change is applied instantly without a page reload.
4\.  On a user's first visit, the application defaults to their operating

```text
 system's theme preference (light or dark).

```text

5\.  The user's subsequent theme selection is persisted in the browser and

```text
 applied on all future visits.

```text

## Tasks / Subtasks

\- \[ \] Configure the Next.js application for theming, following the official

```text
   \`shadcn/ui\` documentation (typically using \`next-themes\`).

```text

\- \[ \] Define the color palettes for both "light" and "dark" themes in the

```text
   global CSS file using CSS variables, adhering to the hex codes in the
   Style Guide.

```text

\- \[ \] Create a \`ThemeToggle\` component (e.g., a button with sun/moon

```text
   icons) and place it in the user menu area of the main layout.

```text

\- \[ \] Implement the logic to detect the user's OS preference on their

```text
   first visit and set the theme accordingly.

```text

\- \[ \] Implement the \`onClick\` handler for the toggle to switch the

```text
   theme.

```text

\- \[ \] Implement the logic to save the user's theme preference to the

```text
   browser's local storage and retrieve it on subsequent page loads.

```text

## Dev Notes

\_ \_\_Prerequisite:\_\* This quest assumes Journey 1 is complete, as a basic
  layout with a user menu area is required to place the toggle.
\_ \_\_Architecture:\_\* Theming must be implemented using CSS variables, as
  is standard practice with Tailwind CSS and \`shadcn/ui\`. This ensures all
  components, including future ones, automatically adapt to the selected
  theme.
\_ \_\_UI:\_\* Refer to the \`Branding & Style Guide\` in the UI/UX
  Specification for the exact color values. The transition between themes
  should be instant and flicker-free.

## Testing

This quest requires both \_\_Component\_\_ and \_\_End-to-End (E2E) Tests\_\_.

\_ \_\_Component Tests (Vitest):\_\*  

```text
\* Test the \`ThemeToggle\` component to ensure it correctly calls the
  theme-switching logic on click.

```text

\_ \_\_E2E Tests (Playwright):\_\*  

```text
\* A test case to verify the application loads the correct default theme
  based on the browser's OS preference setting.
\* A test case that clicks the toggle, verifies the theme changes (e.g.,
  by checking the \`class\` on the \`\<html\>\` element), reloads the page,
  and confirms the selected theme is persisted.

## Manual Test Steps  

1\.  Open the application for the first time. Verify it defaults to your

```text
 operating system's current theme.

```text

2\.  Use the theme toggle in the user menu. Verify all components on the

```text
 page update their colors instantly to the other theme.

```text

3\.  Refresh the page. The application should load with the theme you

```text
 selected, not the OS default.

```text

4\.  Manually clear your browser's local storage for the site and refresh

```text
 again. The application should now revert to your OS default theme.
