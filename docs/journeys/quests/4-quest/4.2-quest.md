# **Quest 4.2: Layout & Navigation Integration**

## **Status: Approved**

## **Quest**

- As a user,  
- I want the application layout and sidebar to function flawlessly on all devices,  
- so that navigation is always intuitive and predictable.

## **Acceptance Criteria (ACs)**

1. The collapsible sidebar correctly expands and collapses with a smooth animation.  
2. The user's preference for the sidebar's state (expanded/collapsed) is correctly saved and restored on page reload.  
3. The sidebar's default state (expanded on desktop, collapsed on tablet) is correctly applied.  
4. All navigation links in the sidebar (`Automations`, `Settings`) navigate to the correct pages.  
5. The application is fully responsive: the grid-to-card and toolbar transformations happen at the `768px` breakpoint.  
6. There is no horizontal overflow or broken layout elements on any screen size, from 320px width up to
   widescreen desktops.

## **Tasks / Subtasks**

- Thoroughly test the sidebar's collapse/expand functionality and its state persistence in local storage.  
- Click every link in the sidebar to ensure it routes to the correct page.  
- Use browser developer tools to test the application at various screen widths, specifically checking the
  `768px` breakpoint.  
- Verify the grid correctly transforms into a card list on mobile.  
- Verify the toolbar correctly transforms into its mobile state.  
- Hunt for any CSS bugs that cause horizontal scrolling on small screens and fix them.

## **Dev Notes**

- **Focus:** This quest is about ensuring the global application shell is robust and works perfectly across
  all devices, as defined in the UI/UX Specification.
