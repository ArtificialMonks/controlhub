# Quest 4.3: Toolbar & Filtering Functionality

## **Status: Approved**

## **Quest**

- As an operator,  
- I want every filter and search control in the toolbar to work perfectly,  
- so that I can reliably find the automations I need.

## **Acceptance Criteria (ACs)**

1. The main search bar correctly filters the grid by Automation Name and Client Name (case-insensitive).  
2. The client `<Select>` dropdown correctly filters the grid to show only automations for the selected client.  
3. The status filter `<Button>` toggles function as multi-select and correctly filter the grid.  
4. All filters can be combined (e.g., search \+ client \+ status) and work together as expected.  
5. The "Clear Filters" button correctly resets all active filters and restores the full, unfiltered grid view.  
6. On mobile, the filters within the drawer/modal have the exact same functionality and work correctly.

## **Tasks / Subtasks**

- Create a comprehensive set of test data with various clients and statuses.  
- Systematically test the search filter with partial and full matches.  
- Test the client filter.  
- Test the status filters, including selecting one, two, and all three statuses.  
- Test combinations of all three filter types to ensure they interact correctly.  
- Test the "Clear Filters" button from various filtered states.  
- Repeat all filter tests on a mobile viewport to validate the mobile filter UI.

## **Testing**

This quest requires comprehensive manual testing of all filtering functionality.

## **Manual Test Steps**

## **Dev Notes**

- **Focus:** This quest is a deep functional test of all client-side filtering logic. The goal is to find and
  fix any bugs related to the state management of the filters.
