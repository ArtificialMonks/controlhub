# **Quest 4.4: Data Grid and Action Button Integration**

## **Status: Approved**

## **Quest**

* As an operator,  
* I want every action button on the dashboard to be fully functional and provide clear feedback,  
* so that I can confidently manage my automations.

## **Acceptance Criteria (ACs)**

1. The "Run" button on each row is correctly disabled when the automation's status is "Running".  
2. The "Run" button, after confirmation, successfully triggers the target automation.  
3. The "Stop" button successfully stops the target automation after confirmation.  
4. The "Run All Filtered" button correctly identifies all visible automations and successfully starts the
   bulk action process.  
5. The "Stop All Filtered" button does the same for stopping.  
6. The UI provides the correct loading states on all buttons during API calls.  
7. The UI provides the correct feedback (Toast/Dialog) for both successful and failed actions, including
   the final summary report for bulk actions.

## **Tasks / Subtasks**

* Review every `onClick` handler for all action buttons (individual Run/Stop, bulk Run/Stop).  
* Verify that the confirmation dialogs appear correctly and display the correct information (e.g.,
  automation name or count).  
* Verify that the correct API endpoints are being called with the correct payloads.  
* Check that the button loading states are correctly applied and removed.  
* Verify that success and error notifications (Toasts) are displayed as expected.  
* For bulk actions, confirm the throttling progress and final summary report are handled correctly by the UI.

## **Dev Notes**

* **Focus:** This is the core functional QA quest for the application's main purpose. It connects every
  frontend click to its intended backend API call and ensures the loop is closed with proper user feedback.

## **Quest 4.5: End-to-End User Flow Validation**

## **Status: Approved** (Continued)

## **Quest** (Continued)

* As a user,  
* I want to perform my key tasks from start to finish without encountering any bugs or inconsistencies,  
* so that I can trust the application.

## **Acceptance Criteria (ACs)** (Continued)

1. The full user login flow is seamless, and session persistence works correctly.  
2. A user can successfully find an automation using filters, run it, and see its status update in real-time.  
3. A user can successfully perform a bulk action on a filtered set of automations and receive the final
   summary report.  
4. A user can switch themes, collapse the sidebar, and resize the screen, and the application state
   remains stable and visually correct.  
5. All interactive elements are fully accessible via keyboard and have proper focus states.

## **Tasks / Subtasks** (Continued)

* Perform a full "smoke test" by running through all the user flows defined in the UI/UX Specification.  
* **Flow 1:** Log in, log out, and log back in.  
* **Flow 2:** Use every filter control to find a specific automation.  
* **Flow 3:** Trigger a single automation and wait to see its status change to "Running" and then to
  "success" or "error" in the grid via the real-time update.  
* **Flow 4:** Perform a bulk action and verify the UI feedback and final report.  
* **General:** While performing the flows, change the theme and collapse/expand the sidebar to check
  for any visual or state-related bugs.

## **Dev Notes** (Continued)

* **Focus:** This is the final integration test and quality check. It is not about finding small
  component bugs but ensuring the major user journeys are solid, seamless, and deliver the intended value.
