# Quest 4.1: Theming and Global Style Validation

## Status: Approved

## Quest

\* As a user,  
\* I want the application's colors and text to be perfectly consistent and readable in both
  light and dark modes,  
\* so that the interface feels polished and professional.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1\.  \[cite\_start\]When in dark mode, the application background must be the correct deep navy
     gradient (\`#0a0b1f\`â†’ \`#002bff\`) and all default text must be white. \[cite: 2\]  
2\.  \[cite\_start\]When in light mode, the application background must be white and all
     default text must be black. \[cite: 1\]  
3\.  \[cite\_start\]The single accent color used for primary buttons and highlights must be the
     correct dark gradient blue in both themes, with no purple or violet tones. \[cite: 3\]  
4\.  \[cite\_start\]The status badge colors must match the specification exactly: Running is
     green (\`#22c55e\`), Stopped is grey (\`#9ca3af\`), and Error is red (\`#ef4444\`).
     \[cite: 4\]  
5\.  Every single component (Buttons, Table, Dialogs, Toasts, Sidebar, Inputs, Selects, Cards)
     must correctly use the theme variables for its text, background, and border colors.  
6\.  Toggling the theme must instantly and correctly apply the color changes to all visible
     components.

## Tasks / Subtasks

\- \[ \] Review the global CSS or Tailwind configuration file to ensure the color palette is
       defined with the exact hex codes from the specification.  
\- \[ \] Systematically go through every component in the application.  
\- \[ \] For each component, toggle between light and dark mode and visually inspect that all
       text, background, and border colors update correctly and match the design.  
\- \[ \] Pay special attention to secondary elements like hover states, focus rings, and
       disabled states to ensure they also respect the theme.  
\- \[ \] Verify the status badges in the data grid have the correct colors.

## Dev Notes

\* \*\*Goal:\*\* The purpose of this quest is to perform a visual QA pass and fix any
  hardcoded colors. Every color in the application should be a variable tied to the current
  theme.  
\* \*\*Reference:\*\* The \`Branding & Style Guide\` in the UI/UX Specification is the
  single source of truth for all color decisions.

## Testing

\* \*\*Manual Testing:\*\* This is primarily a visual testing quest. The developer must
  provide screenshots or a screen recording demonstrating that every component correctly
  adapts to both light and dark themes before this quest can be considered complete.
