# Quest 4.1: Theming and Global Style Validation

## Status: Approved

## Quest

\* As a user,  
\* I want the application's colors and text to be perfectly consistent and readable in both
  light and dark modes,  
\* so that the interface feels polished and professional.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1\.  \[cite\_start\]When in dark mode, the application background must be the correct deep navy

```text
 gradient (\`#0a0b1f\`â†’ \`#002bff\`) and all default text must be white. \[cite: 2\]  

```text

2\.  \[cite\_start\]When in light mode, the application background must be white and all

```text
 default text must be black. \[cite: 1\]  

```text

3\.  \[cite\_start\]The single accent color used for primary buttons and highlights must be the

```text
 correct dark gradient blue in both themes, with no purple or violet tones. \[cite: 3\]  

```text

4\.  \[cite\_start\]The status badge colors must match the specification exactly: Running is

```text
 green (\`#22c55e\`), Stopped is grey (\`#9ca3af\`), and Error is red (\`#ef4444\`).
 \[cite: 4\]  

```text

5\.  Every single component (Buttons, Table, Dialogs, Toasts, Sidebar, Inputs, Selects, Cards)

```text
 must correctly use the theme variables for its text, background, and border colors.  

```text

6\.  Toggling the theme must instantly and correctly apply the color changes to all visible

```text
 components.

```text

## Tasks / Subtasks

\- \[ \] Review the global CSS or Tailwind configuration file to ensure the color palette is

```text
   defined with the exact hex codes from the specification.  

```text

\- \[ \] Systematically go through every component in the application.  
\- \[ \] For each component, toggle between light and dark mode and visually inspect that all

```text
   text, background, and border colors update correctly and match the design.  

```text

\- \[ \] Pay special attention to secondary elements like hover states, focus rings, and

```text
   disabled states to ensure they also respect the theme.  

```text

\- \[ \] Verify the status badges in the data grid have the correct colors.

## Dev Notes

\_ \_\_Goal:\_\* The purpose of this quest is to perform a visual QA pass and fix any
  hardcoded colors. Every color in the application should be a variable tied to the current
  theme.  
\_ \_\_Reference:\_\* The \`Branding & Style Guide\` in the UI/UX Specification is the
  single source of truth for all color decisions.

## Testing

\_ \_\_Manual Testing:\_\* This is primarily a visual testing quest. The developer must
  provide screenshots or a screen recording demonstrating that every component correctly
  adapts to both light and dark themes before this quest can be considered complete.
