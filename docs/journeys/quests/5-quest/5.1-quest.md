# Quest 5.1: Comprehensive Responsive Mobile & Tablet Support

## Status: Approved

## Quest

* As a user,
* I want the application to work seamlessly on mobile and tablet devices with proper responsive behavior,
* so that I can access and use all features effectively regardless of screen size or device type.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. All UI components adapt gracefully to mobile (320px-768px), tablet (768px-1024px), and desktop (1024px+)
   viewports while maintaining perfect readability and usability.
2. The sidebar/navigation panel automatically collapses on mobile and tablet viewports and remains collapsed by
   default, fixing the current inverse behavior.
3. All interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 AAA accessibility standards with minimum 44x44px touch targets for
   optimal touch interaction.
4. The application implements proper CSS breakpoints with mobile-first responsive design patterns throughout all
   components.
5. Performance is optimized for mobile devices including efficient image loading, reduced bundle size, and smooth
   rendering.
6. Touch gestures work intuitively with proper swipe, tap, and scroll behaviors across all interactive elements.
7. The layout maintains visual hierarchy and content priority on smaller screens without horizontal scrolling.

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Audit current responsive design patterns in `tailwind.config.ts` and identify missing mobile-first breakpoints
* [ ] Fix sidebar collapse behavior in `src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx` to default to collapsed on mobile/tablet
* [ ] Update sidebar logic in `src/lib/animations/sidebar-animations.ts` to implement proper mobile-first behavior
* [ ] Review and enhance responsive CSS in `src/app/globals.css` with mobile-optimized media queries
* [ ] Implement touch-friendly sizing for all interactive elements in component library
* [ ] Create responsive layout components at `src/components/layout/ResponsiveContainer.tsx`
* [ ] Add mobile-specific navigation patterns in `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
* [ ] Optimize AutomationsDataTable component for mobile viewing and interaction
* [ ] Implement responsive AutomationsToolbar with collapsible filter controls
* [ ] Add mobile-optimized modal and dialog components with proper touch handling
* [ ] Create responsive breakpoint utilities in `src/lib/responsive/breakpoint-utils.ts`
* [ ] Implement performance optimizations for mobile bundle size and image loading

## Dev Notes

**Prerequisite:** Quest 4.4 (Action Button & Data Grid Integration) must be complete as this quest builds upon
the existing UI components and layout system.

**Architecture:** This quest implements mobile-first responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS breakpoints
and CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts. All components must be tested across the three primary breakpoints: mobile
(320px-768px), tablet (768px-1024px), and desktop (1024px+).

**Current Issue Analysis:** The existing sidebar implementation in `src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx` has inverse
behavior where it expands on smaller screens instead of collapsing. The `checkMobile` function at line 68-76
needs to be corrected to properly handle mobile viewport detection and default to collapsed state.

**Touch-Friendly Standards:** All interactive elements must meet WCAG 2.1 AAA standards with minimum 44x44px
touch targets. This includes buttons, links, form controls, and navigation elements. Refer to W3C accessibility
guidelines for enhanced target size requirements.

**Performance Requirements:** Mobile optimization must include lazy loading for images, code splitting for
non-critical components, and bundle size reduction through tree shaking and dynamic imports.

## Testing

This quest requires comprehensive responsive testing across multiple device types and screen sizes.

**Component Tests (Vitest):**

```text
* Test responsive breakpoint utilities with various viewport sizes
* Test sidebar collapse/expand behavior on mobile vs desktop
* Test touch target sizing meets 44x44px minimum requirements
* Test component rendering across all three breakpoint ranges
* Include accessibility testing with jest-axe for touch targets
```

**E2E Tests (Playwright):**

```text
* Test complete user workflows on mobile devices (iPhone 14 Pro, Samsung Galaxy)
* Test tablet interactions with touch gestures and orientation changes
* Test sidebar behavior across different viewport sizes with browser resize
* Test form interactions and data table usage on mobile devices
* Test performance metrics including LCP, INP, and CLS on mobile
```

**Mobile Device Testing (Manual):**

```text
* Test on actual iOS devices (iPhone 14 Pro, iPad Air) using Safari
* Test on Android devices (Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel) using Chrome
* Test landscape and portrait orientations on tablets
* Test touch gestures including swipe, pinch-to-zoom, and long press
* Test accessibility features including VoiceOver and TalkBack
```

## Manual Test Steps

1. **Desktop to Mobile Transition Testing**
   * Open the application on desktop browser at 1920px width
   * Gradually resize browser window from desktop to tablet to mobile breakpoints
   * Verify sidebar collapses automatically at 768px breakpoint
   * Confirm all content remains accessible without horizontal scrolling

2. **Mobile Device Native Testing**
   * Access application on iPhone 14 Pro in Safari
   * Verify sidebar is collapsed by default and can be toggled via hamburger menu
   * Test all interactive elements can be easily tapped with thumb navigation
   * Confirm text remains readable without zooming

3. **Tablet Landscape/Portrait Testing**
   * Test application on iPad Air in both orientations
   * Verify layout adapts appropriately to orientation changes
   * Confirm sidebar behavior is appropriate for tablet form factor
   * Test data table scrolling and interaction patterns

4. **Touch Interaction Validation**
   * Verify all buttons, links, and form controls meet 44x44px minimum size
   * Test swipe gestures work correctly for dismissible components
   * Confirm touch feedback is immediate and responsive
   * Test accessibility features with screen reader enabled

5. **Performance Validation**
   * Use Chrome DevTools mobile simulation to test Core Web Vitals
   * Verify Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5 seconds on mobile
   * Confirm Interaction to Next Paint (INP) < 200ms for touch interactions
   * Test application performance on slower mobile networks (3G simulation)
