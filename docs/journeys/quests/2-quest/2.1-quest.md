\# Quest 2.1: Implement Toolbar & Filter UI

\#\# Status: Approved

\#\# Quest

\* As an operator,  
\* I want to see all the necessary filter controls on my dashboard,  
\* so that I can prepare to narrow down my list of automations.

\#\# Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1\.  A toolbar is added to the UI above the data grid.  
2\.  The toolbar contains a functional text input field for searching.  
3\.  The toolbar contains a dropdown menu populated with all unique client names from the automation list.  
4\.  The toolbar displays clickable chips for each status (Running, Stopped, Error).  
5\.  The bulk action buttons ("Run All Filtered", "Stop All Filtered") are present in the toolbar.  
6\.  The status filter chips function as multi-select toggles. Clicking an active chip deselects it.  
7\.  A "Clear Filters" button is visible and enabled only when at least one filter (search, client, or status) is active.

\#\# Tasks / Subtasks

\- \[ \] Create a new React component at \`/src/components/features/automations-toolbar/AutomationsToolbar.tsx\`.  
\- \[ \] In the new component, add the required \`shadcn/ui\` components: \`\<Input\>\`, \`\<Select\>\`, and \`\<Button\>\` for the filters and bulk actions.  
\- \[ \] Implement the logic to receive the list of all automations as a prop and derive a unique list of client names to populate the \`\<Select\>\` dropdown.  
\- \[ \] Implement local state management (e.g., using \`useState\` or a Zustand store) to track the current values of the search term, selected client, and active status filters.  
\- \[ \] The component should not yet perform any filtering; it should only display the controls and manage their state.  
\- \[ \] Render the new \`AutomationsToolbar\` component on the main dashboard page, positioned above the \`AutomationsDataTable\`.

\#\# Dev Notes

\* \*\*Prerequisite:\*\* Journey 1 must be complete. This component will require the real automation data from Quest 1.5 to populate the client filter dropdown.  
\* \*\*Architecture:\*\* This is a frontend-only quest. The focus is on building the UI and managing the state of the filter controls. The actual data filtering logic will be implemented in Quest 2.2.  
\* \*\*UI:\*\* All components must be from \`shadcn/ui\` and styled according to the Style Guide. The layout must match the "Toolbar" blueprint in the \`Wireframes & Mockups\` section of the UI/UX Specification.

\#\# Testing

This quest requires \*\*Component Tests\*\* for the \`AutomationsToolbar\` using Vitest and React Testing Library.

\* \*\*Test Cases:\*\*  
    \* Verify all controls (search input, client select, status chips, bulk action buttons) are rendered.  
    \* Verify the client dropdown is correctly populated based on mock data passed to the component.  
    \* Verify the "Clear Filters" button is only visible when a filter is active.  
    \* Include an accessibility check (\`jest-axe\`) in the component test.

\#\# Manual Test Steps  
1\.  Navigate to the dashboard page.  
2\.  Verify the toolbar is displayed above the data grid.  
3\.  Verify the search input, client dropdown, status chips, and bulk action buttons are all visible.  
4\.  Verify the client dropdown is populated with the correct, unique client names from the automations being displayed in the grid below.  
5\.  \*Note: At this stage, interacting with the filters is not expected to have any effect on the data grid.\*
