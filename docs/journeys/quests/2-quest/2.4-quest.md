# Quest 2.4: Wire Up Individual Action Buttons

## Status: Approved

## Quest

\* As an operator,  
\* I want to run or stop a single automation with the click of a button,  
\* so that I can have direct, granular control.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1\.  Clicking the "Run" or "Stop" button on a data grid row displays a descriptive confirmation dialog.  
2\.  Upon user confirmation, the UI calls the appropriate backend endpoint (\`/run\` or \`/stop\`) with the
     correct automation ID.  
3\.  After confirmation, the clicked button enters a disabled, loading state until an API response is received.  
4\.  The UI provides immediate feedback to the user that the command has been sent (e.g., by optimistically
     updating the row's status to "Triggered...").  
5\.  The row's status then updates to "Running" once the telemetry webhook confirms the start.

## Tasks / Subtasks

\- \[ \] Create two new functions in the \`automationService.ts\` file: \`runAutomation(id: string)\` and
  \`stopAutomation(id: string)\`.  
\- \[ \] In the \`AutomationsDataTable\` component, create an \`onClick\` handler for the "Run" button.  
\- \[ \] Implement the handler to open a \`shadcn/ui\` \`\<Dialog\>\` component for confirmation. The dialog
  should display the name of the automation about to be run.  
\- \[ \] If the user confirms the action, call the \`runAutomation(id)\` service function from the handler.  
\- \[ \] Implement the disabled/loading state for the button while the API call is in progress.  
\- \[ \] Implement an optimistic UI update to change the row's status locally to "Triggered...".  
\- \[ \] Repeat the implementation steps for the "Stop" button.

## Dev Notes

\* \*\*Prerequisite:\*\* This quest requires Quest 2.3 to be complete. The backend endpoints for running and
  stopping automations must be functional.  
\* \*\*Architecture:\*\* This is a frontend-only quest. All API communication must go through the centralized
  API client and the \`automationService\`. Do not use \`fetch\` directly in the component.  
\* \*\*UI:\*\* The confirmation dialog is a critical part of the UX. It \*\*must\*\* be a \`shadcn/ui\` Dialog and
  should clearly state the name of the automation the user is about to affect (e.g., 'Are you sure you want to
  run "Sync Salesforce Leads"?').

## Testing

This quest requires \*\*Component Tests\*\* for the interactive elements of the \`AutomationsDataTable\` using
Vitest and React Testing Library.

\* \*\*Test Cases:\*\*  
    \* Mock the API service.  
    \* Test that clicking the "Run" button shows the confirmation dialog.  
    \* Test that confirming the dialog calls the correct API service function.  
    \* Test that the button enters a loading state while the API call is in progress.  
    \* Test that canceling the dialog does not call the API service.

## Manual Test Steps  

1\.  Navigate to the dashboard.  
2\.  Click the "Run" button on any row. A confirmation dialog should appear, mentioning the specific
     automation's name.  
3\.  Click "Cancel." The dialog should close, and no network request should be made.  
4\.  Click "Run" again, then click "Confirm."  
5\.  The button should briefly show a loading state.  
6\.  Check your browser's developer tools "Network" tab to verify that a \`POST\` request was made to the
     correct \`/api/automations/{id}/run\` endpoint and that it returned a success status.
