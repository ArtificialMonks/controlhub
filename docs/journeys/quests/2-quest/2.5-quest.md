\# Quest 2.5: Implement Bulk Actions with Throttling

\#\# Status: Approved

\#\# Quest

\* As an operator,  
\* I want to run or stop all currently visible automations at once,  
\* so that I can efficiently manage large groups of workflows.

\#\# Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1\.  Clicking "Run All Filtered" or "Stop All Filtered" shows a confirmation dialog specifying the number of automations that will be affected.  
2\.  Upon confirmation, the frontend sends the list of all visible automation IDs to a dedicated bulk action endpoint on the backend.  
3\.  The backend initiates the defined throttling mechanism: jobs are processed in batches of max 200, with a 4-minute delay between each batch.  
4\.  The UI provides clear feedback on the bulk action's progress (e.g., "Running batch 1 of 5... Next batch in 3:59...").  
5\.  The backend process does not stop if a single workflow fails to trigger; it continues processing the entire batch.  
6\.  After the final batch is processed, the backend returns a summary report, including the total number of successes and a list of any specific failures.  
7\.  The UI displays this summary report to the user in a clear, non-intrusive way (e.g., a toast notification).

\#\# Tasks / Subtasks

\- \[ \] \*\*Backend:\*\* Create a new API route at \`/src/app/api/automations/bulk-action/route.ts\`.  
\- \[ \] \*\*Backend:\*\* The API route should accept a \`POST\` request with a body containing an \`action\` ('run' or 'stop') and an array of \`automationIds\`.  
\- \[ \] \*\*Backend:\*\* Implement the throttling and batching logic in a service layer. The service should break the \`automationIds\` array into chunks of 200\.  
\- \[ \] \*\*Backend:\*\* The service should process the first chunk, then wait 4 minutes before processing the next, and so on, until all chunks are complete. This must be handled as an asynchronous process.  
\- \[ \] \*\*Backend:\*\* The service must collect a list of successes and failures and return a final summary report in the API response.  
\- \[ \] \*\*Frontend:\*\* In the \`AutomationsToolbar\` component, implement the \`onClick\` handler for the "Run All Filtered" and "Stop All Filtered" buttons.  
\- \[ \] \*\*Frontend:\*\* The handler should get the list of IDs from the currently filtered automations.  
\- \[ \] \*\*Frontend:\*\* On confirmation, the handler should call the new \`/api/automations/bulk-action\` endpoint.  
\- \[ \] \*\*Frontend:\*\* While the bulk action is processing, the UI should show an indeterminate loading state (e.g., a spinning icon on the button).  
\- \[ \] \*\*Frontend:\*\* When the final summary report is received from the backend, display it to the user in a \`shadcn/ui\` Toast or Dialog.

\#\# Dev Notes

\* \*\*Prerequisite:\*\* This quest requires Quest 2.2 (Filtering) and Quest 2.3 (Backend for individual actions) to be complete.  
\* \*\*CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE NOTE:\*\* A long-running bulk action (e.g., 1000 automations in 5 batches with a 4-minute delay \= 16+ minutes) will \*\*exceed the maximum execution time\*\* for a standard Vercel serverless function. A simple \`await delay(240000)\` will fail. The architect must be consulted on the final implementation, which may require using a background job queue (e.g., Vercel Cron triggering jobs from a database queue) instead of a single, long-running API request. This quest defines the \*user-facing behavior\*; the technical implementation must be robust.  
\* \*\*UI Feedback:\*\* Clear feedback is essential. The bulk action buttons must be disabled while a bulk action is in progress to prevent multiple simultaneous requests.

\#\# Testing

This quest requires \*\*Integration Tests\*\* for the \`bulk-action\` API endpoint and \*\*E2E Tests\*\*.

\* \*\*Backend Integration Tests (Vitest):\*\*  
    \* Test that a large list of IDs is correctly broken into batches.  
    \* Use fake timers (\`vi.useFakeTimers\`) to test the delay logic without actually waiting for minutes.  
    \* Test the partial failure case: the endpoint should still complete and the report should list the failures.  
\* \*\*E2E Tests (Playwright):\*\*  
    \* Test the full user flow: filter the grid, click a bulk action button, confirm the dialog, and verify that the UI shows a processing state and eventually a completion message.

\#\# Manual Test Steps  
1\.  Navigate to the dashboard and filter the list to show 3-4 automations.  
2\.  Click "Run All Filtered." Verify the confirmation dialog shows the correct count of automations.  
3\.  Confirm the action. The UI should indicate that a process is running, and the button should be disabled.  
4\.  Check the Network tab to see the \`POST\` request to \`/api/automations/bulk-action\`.  
5\.  Use \`webhook.site\` for the webhook URLs to verify that all automations in the filtered list were triggered.  
6\.  Verify that the final summary report is displayed correctly in the UI.
