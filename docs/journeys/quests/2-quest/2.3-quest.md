# Quest 2.3: Create Backend for Individual Actions

## Status: Approved

## Quest

\* As the system,  
\* I need a secure way to trigger or stop a specific n8n workflow,  
\* so that I can fulfill user requests from the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1\.  A secure backend endpoint (e.g., \`/api/automations/{id}/run\`) is

```text
 created to handle POST requests.

```text

2\.  A secure backend endpoint (e.g., \`/api/automations/{id}/stop\`) is

```text
 created to handle POST requests.

```text

3\.  Both endpoints validate that the authenticated user has permission to

```text
 perform the action on the requested automation.

```text

4\.  The endpoints retrieve the correct, encrypted n8n webhook URL from the

```text
 database based on the automation's ID.

```text

5\.  The endpoints successfully trigger the corresponding n8n webhook.
6\.  Upon success, the endpoint returns a \`200 OK\` status with a JSON body:

```text
 \`{ "success": true, "message": "Action triggered successfully." }\`.

```text

7\.  Upon failure, the endpoint returns an appropriate error status with a

```text
 JSON body: \`{ "success": false, "message": "Failed to trigger action." }\`.

```text

## Tasks / Subtasks

\- \[ \] Create the API Route file structure:

```text
   \`/src/app/api/automations/\[id\]/run/route.ts\` and
   \`.../stop/route.ts\`.

```text

\- \[ \] Implement the \`POST\` handler for the \`run\` endpoint.  
\- \[ \] Implement the \`POST\` handler for the \`stop\` endpoint.  
\- \[ \] In each handler, ensure the user session is valid (this should be

```text
   handled by the middleware from Quest 1.2).

```text

\- \[ \] Create/extend the \`Repository Layer\` to include a function to

```text
   retrieve a single automation (including its webhook URL) by its ID.

```text

\- \[ \] Implement an authorization check in each handler to verify that the

```text
   requested automation belongs to the authenticated user's
   client/organization.

```text

\- \[ \] Create an \`n8n Webhook Service\` in \`/src/lib/services/\` that

```text
   contains the logic for making the outbound \`POST\` request to a given
   n8n webhook URL.

```text

\- \[ \] Call the appropriate service functions from the API route handlers.  
\- \[ \] Implement the standardized JSON success and error responses.

## Dev Notes

\_ \_\_Prerequisite:\_\* Journey 1 must be complete. The \`automations\` table
  must exist and the authentication middleware must be active.
\_ \_\_Architecture:\_\* This is a backend-only quest. The API route handlers
  should be thin "controllers." All database logic must be in the
  \`Repository Layer\`, and the logic for making the outbound call to n8n must
  be in the \`n8n Webhook Service\`.
\_ \_\_Security:\_\* These endpoints must be protected by the authentication
  middleware. Crucially, you must also add an \_\_authorization\_\_ check
  inside each handler to prevent a user from one client from
  running/stopping an automation belonging to another client.

## Testing

This quest requires \_\_Integration Tests\_\_ for both API endpoints using
Vitest.

\_ \_\_Test Cases:\_\*  

```text
\* Mock the service/repository layers to test the API routes in
  isolation.
\* Test the success case for both \`run\` and \`stop\` endpoints.  
\* Test the failure case where a user is unauthenticated (the middleware
  should block this).
\* Test the failure case where an automation ID does not exist (should
  return 404).
\* Test the authorization failure case (a user from Client A trying to
  act on an automation for Client B should be blocked).

```text

## Manual Test Steps  

1\.  Use a tool like Postman to make a \`POST\` request to your local

```text
 \`.../api/automations/{id}/run\` endpoint, replacing \`{id}\` with a valid
 automation ID from your database.

```text

2\.  First, make the request \_without\_ a valid Supabase Auth JWT in the

```text
 \`Authorization\` header. It must return a \`401 Unauthorized\` error.

```text

3\.  Next, add a valid JWT to the header for a user who is authorized to

```text
 access that automation. The request should succeed and return a
 \`200 OK\`.

```text

4\.  To test the actual webhook trigger, you can temporarily replace an

```text
 \`n8n\_run\_webhook\_url\` in your database with a URL from a service like
 \`webhook.site\`. When you call your API endpoint, you should see the
 request arrive at \`webhook.site\`.
