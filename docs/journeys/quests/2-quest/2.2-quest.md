\# Quest 2.2: Implement Client-Side Filtering Logic

\#\# Status: Approved

\#\# Quest

\* As an operator,  
\* I want to use the filters to instantly narrow down the list of automations,  
\* so that I can quickly find the specific ones I'm looking for.

\#\# Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1\.  Typing in the search bar filters the grid in real-time to show only rows where the Automation Name or Client Name matches the search term.  
2\.  Selecting a client from the dropdown filters the grid to show only automations for that client.  
3\.  Clicking the status chips filters the grid. Multiple statuses can be selected at once.  
4\.  All filters can be combined (e.g., search for "report" for "Client A" with "Error" status).  
5\.  A "Clear Filters" button or similar mechanism is available to reset the view to its default, unfiltered state.

\#\# Tasks / Subtasks

\- \[ \] Lift the state for the full automation list and the filter values to a shared parent component or a Zustand store so both the toolbar and the data grid can access them.  
\- \[ \] Create a memoized, derived state (e.g., using \`useMemo\`) that computes the filtered list of automations whenever the master list or any filter value changes.  
\- \[ \] Implement the case-insensitive search logic.  
\- \[ \] Implement the logic to filter by the selected client ID.  
\- \[ \] Implement the logic for the multi-select status filter chips.  
\- \[ \] Implement the "Clear Filters" functionality, which should reset all filter states to their defaults.  
\- \[ \] Pass the newly computed, filtered list of automations as a prop to the \`AutomationsDataTable\` component.

\#\# Dev Notes

\* \*\*Prerequisite:\*\* This quest requires Quest 2.1 to be complete. The \`AutomationsToolbar\` component must be built.  
\* \*\*Architecture:\*\* For the MVP, all filtering logic will be implemented on the \*\*client-side\*\*. The frontend will fetch the complete list of automations once, and then apply filtering directly in the browser. Use memoization to prevent re-calculating the filtered list unnecessarily on every re-render.  
\* \*\*UI:\*\* The data grid should re-render instantly as the user interacts with any filter control. If the filtering results in an empty list, the "Empty State" component (defined in the UI/UX spec) should be displayed in place of the data grid.

\#\# Testing

This quest requires \*\*Component Tests\*\* for the component that manages the filtering logic.

\* \*\*Test Cases:\*\*  
    \* Write a test for each filter type in isolation (search, client, status).  
    \* Write a test that combines multiple filters at once.  
    \* Write a test for the "Clear Filters" functionality.  
    \* Write a test for the edge case where filtering results in an empty array.

\#\# Manual Test Steps  
1\.  Navigate to the dashboard page, which should be populated with a list of automations.  
2\.  Type a partial name of an automation in the search bar and verify the grid updates instantly to show only matching rows.  
3\.  Clear the search. Select a client from the dropdown and verify the grid updates to show only that client's automations.  
4\.  With a client selected, click on a status chip (e.g., 'Error') and verify the grid is further filtered.  
5\.  Click the 'Clear Filters' button and verify the grid returns to its original, unfiltered state.  
6\.  Apply a filter that results in no matches and verify the "Empty State" component is displayed with a helpful message.
