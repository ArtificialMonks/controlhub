# Quest 1.5: Real-Time Data Display

## Status: Approved

## Quest

\* As a user,  
\* I want to see a live, read-only list of all my automations on the dashboard,  
\* so that I can monitor their status at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1\.  On loading the dashboard, the data grid fetches and displays all
     automations from the database.
2\.  The status badge for each automation is displayed with the correct color
     based on the \`status\` field from the database.
3\.  The grid utilizes a real-time subscription (e.g., via Supabase
     Realtime) to update rows instantly when their corresponding data changes
     in the database, without requiring a page refresh.
4\.  The "Last Run" and "Avg Duration" columns display human-readable,
     formatted data (e.g., "5 minutes ago", "3.2 seconds").

## Tasks / Subtasks

\- \[ \] Create the \`GET /api/automations\` API route.  
\- \[ \] Implement the API route's logic to call a new function in the
       \`Repository Layer\` that fetches all automations associated with the
       authenticated user's client.
\- \[ \] Modify the \`AutomationsDataTable\` component to remove the static
       mock data and accept real data as props.
\- \[ \] Implement a client-side data fetching hook (e.g., \`useAutomations\`)
       that calls the \`GET /api/automations\` endpoint on initial component
       mount.
\- \[ \] Connect the data from the hook to the \`AutomationsDataTable\`
       component to display the initial list.
\- \[ \] Implement the Supabase Realtime subscription within the React
       component or hook to listen for changes (inserts, updates) on the
       \`automations\` table.
\- \[ \] Implement the logic to update the local state when a real-time event
       is received, causing the UI to re-render with the new data.
\- \[ \] Create and apply utility functions to format the \`last\_run\_at\`
       and \`avg\_duration\_ms\` data for display.

## Dev Notes

\* \*\*Prerequisite:\*\* This quest requires Quests 1.2 (Auth), 1.3
  (Telemetry Endpoint), and 1.4 (DB Schema & UI Grid) to be complete.
\* \*\*Architecture:\*\* This is the capstone quest for Journey 1\. The data
  flow is: the Backend API fetches the initial data list, and the Supabase
  Realtime subscription provides all subsequent updates directly to the
  client. Do not use manual polling.
\* \*\*UI:\*\* To improve user experience, consider adding a subtle highlight
  animation to a row that has just been updated via the real-time subscription
  to gently draw the user's attention to the change.

## Testing

This quest requires \*\*Integration and End-to-End Tests\*\*.

\* \*\*Integration Tests (Vitest):\*\*  
    \* Test the \`GET /api/automations\` endpoint to ensure it correctly
      returns data and enforces security (a user from Client A should not be
      able to see data from Client B).
    \* Test the frontend data fetching hook (\`useAutomations\`) by mocking
      the API response.
\* \*\*E2E Tests (Playwright):\*\*  
    \* Update the E2E tests to log in and verify that a list of mock
      automations (seeded in the test database) is correctly displayed in
      the grid.

## Manual Test Steps  

1\.  Manually add 2-3 sample automations to your local Supabase database for
     a specific client.
2\.  Log in to the application as a user associated with that client.
3\.  Verify that the data grid on the dashboard correctly displays the
     automations you added.
4\.  While keeping the dashboard open in your browser, go to the Supabase
     Studio (dashboard) and manually change the \`status\` of one of the
     automations (e.g., from 'Stopped' to 'Running').
5\.  Verify that the status badge for that automation in your web app
     updates automatically within a few seconds without you having to refresh
     the page.
