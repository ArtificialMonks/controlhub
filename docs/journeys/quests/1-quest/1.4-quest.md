# Quest 1.4: Database Schema & Read-Only UI Grid

## Status: Approved

## Quest

\* As a developer,  
\* I want a database schema and a basic UI grid component,  
\* so that I have the foundation to display automation data.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1\.  Using a database migration file, a table named \`automations\` (along with \`clients\`, \`profiles\`,

```text
 and \`automation\_runs\`) is created in the Supabase Postgres database.  

```text

2\.  The tables include all columns and relationships as defined in the Architecture Document.  
3\.  A basic, read-only data grid UI component is created using \`shadcn/ui\`'s \`\<Table\>\`.  
4\.  The grid component correctly renders its layout and all required headers when populated with static, mock data.

## Tasks / Subtasks

\- \[ \] Create a new SQL migration file inside the \`/supabase/migrations/\` directory.  
\- \[ \] In the migration file, write the \`CREATE TABLE\` statements for \`clients\`, \`profiles\`,
  \`automations\`, and \`automation\_runs\` exactly as specified in the \`Database Schema\` section of the
  architecture document.  
\- \[ \] Run the migration against your local Supabase instance to apply the new schema.  
\- \[ \] Create a new React component file at
  \`/src/components/features/automations-data-table/AutomationsDataTable.tsx\`.  
\- \[ \] Use \`shadcn/ui\`'s \`\<Table\>\` component to build the grid structure with headers for: Automation
  Name, Client, Status, Last Run, Avg Duration, and Actions.  
\- \[ \] Create a mock data array and pass it to the component to verify that it renders the layout and
  styles correctly.  
\- \[ \] Render the new \`AutomationsDataTable\` component on the main dashboard page
  (\`/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx\`).

## Dev Notes

\_ \_\_Prerequisite:\_\* This quest assumes Quest 1.1 (scaffolding) is complete.  
\_ \_\_Architecture:\_\* The SQL schema for the tables must exactly match the \`Database Schema\` section
  of the \`fullstack-architecture.md\` document to ensure consistency.  
\_ \_\_UI Focus:\_\* This quest is about creating a "dumb" presentational component. It should only be
  concerned with displaying the mock data passed to it via props. The logic for fetching real data from the
  backend will be handled in Quest 1.5.  
\_ \_\_Mock Data:\_\* Ensure the mock data includes examples for each status ('Running', 'Stopped',
  'Error') so the status badge styling can be implemented and verified.

## Testing

This quest requires \_\_Component Tests\_\_ for the \`AutomationsDataTable\` using Vitest and React Testing Library.

\_ \_\_Test Cases:\_\*  

```text
\* Verify the component renders correctly with a sample of mock data.  
\* Verify all expected table headers are displayed.  
\* Verify the correct number of rows is rendered based on the mock data provided.  
\* Include an accessibility check (\`jest-axe\`) in the component test.

```text

## Manual Test Steps  

1\.  After running the database migration, verify in the Supabase Studio (your local or cloud dashboard)

```text
 that all four new tables exist with the correct columns.  

```text

2\.  Navigate to the \`/dashboard\` page in the local development environment.  
3\.  Verify that the data grid is visible and populated with the static mock data.  
4\.  Verify that all table headers are present and correctly spelled.
