\# Quest 1.3: Backend Telemetry Endpoint

\#\# Status: Approved

\#\# Quest

\* As the system,  
\* I want to securely receive and store automation data from n8n,  
\* so that I can provide real-time status updates to the user.

\#\# Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1\.  A secure backend API endpoint is created at \`/api/webhooks/n8n\` to receive POST requests.  
2\.  The endpoint authenticates incoming requests using a secret token (from the \`N8N\_WEBHOOK\_SECRET\` environment variable) to ensure they originate from n8n.  
3\.  The endpoint successfully parses and validates a simplified JSON payload containing only essential completion data: \`final\_status\` (e.g., 'success', 'error'), an optional \`error\_message\`, and \`execution\_time\_ms\`.  
4\.  The processed data is correctly saved to the appropriate table(s) in the Supabase database via the Repository Layer.

\#\# Tasks / Subtasks

\- \[ \] Create the new API Route file at \`/src/app/api/webhooks/n8n/route.ts\`.  
\- \[ \] Implement logic to read a secret token from the \`N8N\_WEBHOOK\_SECRET\` environment variable.  
\- \[ \] Implement an authentication check in the API route. It should expect the secret token in an \`Authorization\` header and return a \`401 Unauthorized\` error if it's missing or incorrect.  
\- \[ \] Define a schema (e.g., using Zod) for the incoming webhook payload and validate the request body against it.  
\- \[ \] Create or extend the \`Repository Layer\` with a function to update the \`automations\` table and create a new record in the \`automation\_runs\` table.  
\- \[ \] Implement the API route logic to call the repository function with the validated data.

\#\# Dev Notes

\* \*\*Prerequisite:\*\* Quest 1.1 must be complete, and the \`N8N\_WEBHOOK\_SECRET\` variable must be defined in your \`.env.local\` file with a strong, randomly generated value.  
\* \*\*Architecture:\*\* This endpoint is the core of our "Enhanced Telemetry" system. It must be highly reliable and performant. All database logic \*\*must\*\* be handled by the \`Repository Layer\`. Do not put raw Supabase queries in the API route.  
\* \*\*Security:\*\* This endpoint is publicly accessible but secured by a secret token. It should not use the standard Supabase JWT user authentication, as requests will be coming from the n8n server, not a logged-in user.

\#\# Testing

This quest requires \*\*Integration Tests\*\* using a framework like Vitest.

\* \*\*Test Cases:\*\*  
    \* Test a successful webhook POST with a valid payload and the correct secret token.  
    \* Test a rejected POST with an incorrect secret token (should return 401).  
    \* Test a rejected POST with an invalid or malformed JSON payload (should return 400).

\#\# Manual Test Steps  
1\.  Use a tool like Postman or \`curl\` to send a POST request to your local development URL for this endpoint (\`http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/n8n\`).  
2\.  First, send the request with an incorrect \`Authorization\` header; it must return a \`401 Unauthorized\` error.  
3\.  Next, send the request with the correct secret and a valid JSON payload. It must return a \`200 OK\` success response.  
4\.  Verify in your Supabase dashboard that the \`automations\` and \`automation\_runs\` tables were updated correctly.
