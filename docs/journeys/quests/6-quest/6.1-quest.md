# Quest 6.1: Enterprise-Grade Settings Page Development

## Status: Approved

## Quest

* As a user,
* I want a comprehensive, enterprise-grade Settings page that matches the visual design system from the Dashboard page,
* so that I can manage my account preferences, automation settings, security configurations, and application customization with a consistent and professional user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The Settings page must perfectly match the Dashboard page's visual design language including typography (Orbitron font), color palette (dark gradient #0a0b1f→#002bff, accent blue #003cff→#0066ff), and component styling patterns.
2. All settings functionality must be fully operational with real-time persistence to Supabase database and immediate UI feedback for all user interactions.
3. The page must implement comprehensive settings categories: User Profile, Appearance & Theme, Automation Settings, Security & Privacy, Integration Settings, and Notification Settings.
4. All components must be fully responsive across mobile (320px-768px), tablet (768px-1024px), and desktop (1024px+) viewports with proper touch targets (minimum 44px).
5. The implementation must achieve zero TypeScript compilation errors, zero ESLint warnings, and 100% compliance with A.V.A.R.I.C.E. Protocol quality standards.
6. All settings changes must include proper validation, error handling, loading states, and success feedback with optimistic updates for enhanced user experience.
7. The page must maintain full accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

## Dev Notes

**Prerequisite:** Quest 5.1 (Responsive Mobile & Tablet Support) must be complete as this quest builds upon the responsive design system and sidebar integration.

**Architecture:** This quest implements enterprise-grade settings management using Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript strict mode, shadcn/ui components, and Supabase for data persistence. The implementation follows the Repository Layer pattern for data access abstraction.

**Visual Design Consistency:** The Settings page must achieve 100% visual consistency with the Dashboard page. This includes:

* Typography: Orbitron font for headings with identical font weights and letter-spacing
* Color Palette: Dark gradient background (#0a0b1f→#002bff), accent blue gradients (#003cff→#0066ff)
* Component Styling: Glass morphism effects, animated borders, hover transitions
* Layout: Consistent spacing, shadows, border radius, and card styling patterns

**Data Architecture:** Settings data must be stored in Supabase with proper schema design including:

* User preferences table with JSON columns for flexible settings storage
* Audit trail for settings changes with timestamps and change tracking
* Real-time subscriptions for immediate UI updates across sessions
* Encrypted storage for sensitive settings like API keys and security preferences

**Performance Requirements:** The Settings page must maintain optimal performance with:

* Lazy loading for non-critical settings sections
* Optimistic updates for immediate user feedback
* Debounced API calls for real-time settings changes
* Efficient re-rendering with React optimization patterns

## Testing
