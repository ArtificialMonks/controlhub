# **Communitee Control Hub UI/UX Specification**

## **Introduction**

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture,
user flows,
and visual design specifications for the Communitee Control Hub. It serves as
the
foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and
user-centered experience.

### **Overall UX Goals & Principles**

Our design is guided by a core philosophy of "Radical Simplicity for a
Professional Tool." To achieve a balance between a sleek, efficient interface
and a
friendly, helpful experience, we will adhere to the following principles:

1. **Clarity First:** Prioritize clear information and intuitive actions over
   visual
   complexity. The user should always know what to do next.  
2. **Efficiency by Default:** Design workflows to be fast and streamlined,
   allowing professional users to accomplish their tasks with minimum friction.
3. **Friendly & Forgiving:** Use helpful, playful text and clear, descriptive
   confirmation dialogs to create a reassuring and error-resistant experience.  
4. **Progressive Disclosure:** Present a simple, clean view by default. Allow
   power
   users to easily access more advanced filters and data columns when they
   need them.

### **Target User Personas**

- **Primary: The Non-Technical Operator:** A tech-savvy professional (Marketing,
  Ops, etc.) who needs to manage automations but is not a developer. They value
  self-sufficiency and fear breaking things.  
- **Secondary: The End-Client:** An external stakeholder who needs read-only
  transparency into the status of the automations they are paying for. They
  value
  peace of mind and clear communication.  
- **Secondary: The Developer / Administrator:** The technical user who sets up
  the
  system and needs to safely delegate routine management tasks to the primary
  user.

### **Usability Goals**

- **Ease of Learning:** A new operator should be able to confidently perform a
  core action (e.g., run or stop an automation) within their first 5 minutes of
  using the tool.  
- **Efficiency of Use:** An experienced operator should be able to complete
  their
  daily monitoring and management tasks in under 5 minutes.  
- **Error Prevention:** The design must actively prevent user error, especially
  concerning powerful bulk actions, through the use of descriptive confirmation
  dialogs.  
- **High User Confidence:** Users should report a high level of confidence and
  low
  level of anxiety when interacting with the system, measured via user feedback.

## **Information Architecture (IA)**

### **Site Map / Screen Inventory**

This diagram shows the overall structure of the application, including planned
post-MVP sections to ensure our architecture is scalable.

style J\_Future fill:\#f9f9f9,stroke:\#333,stroke-dasharray: 5 5

```text

```text

### **Navigation Structure**

- **Primary Navigation:** The primary method of navigation is the
  **collapsible left
  sidebar**. It will be designed to scale and will contain the following
  items:
  - **MVP Items:**  

```text

- **Automations:** The main dashboard view with the data grid.  
- **Settings:** For user and workspace settings.  

```text

  - **Post-MVP Items:**  

```text

- **Analytics:** A dedicated section for data visualization and reporting.  
- **Health:** A view for system health trends and detailed execution logs.  
- **Client Management:** An area for agencies to manage their clients and

```text


```text
  portal
  access.  

```text

```text

- **Help & Docs:** A link to support resources.  

```text

- **Secondary Navigation:** The toolbar on the main dashboard contains filtering
  and
  action controls, not secondary navigation links. Therefore, no dedicated
  secondary
  navigation system is required for the MVP.  
- **Breadcrumb Strategy:** The initial application has a flat structure, so
  breadcrumbs are not necessary for the MVP. This strategy should be revisited
  if
  future features introduce more deeply nested pages.

## **User Flows**

### **Flow 1: User Login and Authentication**

- **User Goal:** To securely access their private workspace and the automations
  dashboard.  
- **Entry Points:** Direct navigation to the application URL.  
- **Success Criteria:** The user successfully logs in and is redirected to the
  main
  "Automations Dashboard".

#### **Flow Diagram**

```mermaid
graph TD  

```text
A\[Start\] \--\> B\[Visit App URL\];  
B \--\> C\[Login Screen\];  
C \--\> D\[User Enters Credentials\];  
D \--\> E{Supabase Auth Valid?};  
E \--\>|Yes| F\[Redirect to Dashboard\];  
E \--\>|No| G\[Show Error on Screen\];  
G \--\> C;  
F \--\> H\[End\];

```text

```text

#### **Edge Cases & Error Handling**

- **Invalid Credentials:** Display a clear "Invalid email or password" error
  message.  
- **Magic Link Expired:** If using magic links, provide an option to resend the
  link.  
- **Service Unavailable:** Display a "Login service is temporarily unavailable"
  message if Supabase cannot be reached.

---

### **Flow 2: Find a Specific Automation**

- **User Goal:** To quickly locate a specific automation or group of
  automations.  
- **Entry Points:** The Automations Dashboard.  
- **Success Criteria:** The user successfully applies filters and the data grid
  updates in real-time to show the desired results.  
- **UX Refinements:**  
  - **Search Logic:** The search functionality should be user-friendly, matching

```text
any part of the Automation Name or Client Name in a **case-insensitive**
manner.

```text

- **State Preservation:** The applied filter state (search term, client,

```text
statuses) should be preserved throughout the user's session (e.g., by using
URL
query parameters). This prevents the frustrating "Lost Filters" scenario.

```text

#### **Flow Diagram**

```mermaid
graph TD  

```text
A\[Start on Dashboard\] \--\> B\[Interact with Toolbar Filters\];  
B \--\> C{Apply Search, Client, or Status Filter};  
C \--\> D\[Data Grid Updates Instantly\];  
D \--\> E\[User Locates Automation\];  
E \--\> F\[End\];

```text

```text

#### **Edge Cases & Error Handling**

- **No Results Found:** The grid area should display the well-designed
  "Empty State
  View" with a helpful message like "No automations match your filters. Try
  clearing them."

---

### **Flow 3: Run a Single Automation**

- **User Goal:** To manually trigger a single, specific automation.  
- **Entry Points:** A row in the data grid on the Automations Dashboard.  
- **Success Criteria:** The user confirms the action, the command is sent, and
  the
  UI provides feedback.  
- **UX Refinements:**  
  - **Prevent Double-Run:** The "Run" button must be **disabled** if the

```text
automation's current status is "Running" to prevent accidental duplicate
triggers.

```text

#### **Flow Diagram**

```mermaid
graph TD  

```text
A\[Start on Dashboard\] \--\> B\[Locate Automation in Grid\];  
B \--\> C{Is Status 'Running'?};  
C \--\>|Yes| D\["Run" Button is Disabled\];  
C \--\>|No| E\[Click "Run" Button\];  
E \--\> F\[Show Descriptive Confirmation Modal\];  
F \--\> G{User Confirms?};  
G \--\>|Yes| H\[UI Sends Request to Backend\];  
H \--\> I\[Button Enters Loading State\];  
I \--\> J\[Row Status Optimistically Updates\];  
J \--\> K\[End\];  
G \--\>|No| L\[Close Modal\];  
L \--\> A;

```text

```text

#### **Edge Cases & Error Handling**

- **User Cancels:** If the user clicks "Cancel" in the modal, the modal closes
  and
  no action is taken. The filter state remains unchanged.  
- **API Error:** If the backend returns an error, display a toast notification
  to
  the user (e.g., "Error: Could not trigger automation.") and return the button
  to
  its normal state.

---

### **Flow 4: Perform a Bulk Action**

- **User Goal:** To efficiently run or stop a large group of filtered
  automations
  at once.  
- **Entry Points:** The toolbar on the Automations Dashboard.  
- **Success Criteria:** The user confirms the bulk action, the backend begins
  the
  throttled process, and the UI provides clear progress and a final summary.  
- **UX Refinements:**  
  - **Clarify Progress:** The UI must be very clear that it is showing the

```text
progress
of _sending triggers_, not the progress of the automations themselves
completing.

```text

- **Final Summary:** A final report must be shown to the user, confirming what

```text
succeeded and what failed.

```text

#### **Flow Diagram**

```mermaid
graph TD  

```text
A\[Start on Dashboard\] \--\> B\[Apply Filters to Grid\];  
B \--\> C\[Click "Run All Filtered" Button\];  
C \--\> D\[Show Confirmation Modal with Automation Count\];  
D \--\> E{User Confirms?};  
E \--\>|Yes| F\[UI Sends List of IDs to Backend\];  
F \--\> G\[UI Displays "Sending Triggers..." Progress\];  
G \--\> H\[Backend Returns Final Summary Report\];  
H \--\> I\[UI Displays Success/Failure Report Modal\];  
I \--\> J\[End\];  
E \--\>|No| K\[Close Modal\];  
K \--\> A;

```text

```text

#### **Edge Cases & Error Handling**

- **No Automations Filtered:** The bulk action buttons should be disabled if the
  current filter results in zero visible automations.

## **Wireframes & Mockups**

Given our choice of **React** and **shadcn/ui**, we will follow a
component-driven,
"design-in-the-browser" methodology. High-fidelity visual mockups in a separate
design tool are not required. Instead, this specification will serve as the
blueprint for developers building the interface directly in Visual Studio Code.

**Primary Design & Development Tools:** React, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS,
Visual Studio Code

### **Key Screen Layouts**

#### **Main Dashboard (Automations View)**

- **Purpose:** To provide a comprehensive, at-a-glance view of all automations
  and
  serve as the primary control panel for the user.  
- **Component Blueprint:**  
  1. **Global Collapsible Sidebar (Left):**  
     - Contains the primary navigation links.  
     - **Component:** Use shadcn \<Button variant="ghost"\> for each navigation

```text
   item
   to create a clean, modern look. Each button should have an icon from the
   lucide-react library (e.g., \<LayoutDashboard\>, \<Settings\>) followed by
   the
   text label.  

```text

  1. **Main Content Area (Right):**  
     - **Hero Banner:** A simple, non-intrusive banner.  
     - **Toolbar:** A dedicated toolbar using a flex container.  
       - **Search:** Use \<Input type="search" placeholder="Search client or

```text
     automation..."\>.  

```text

       - **Client Selector:** Use a \<Select\> component with a

```text
     \<SelectTrigger\>
     showing "All Clients" by default. If the client list is long, this
     should
     include a search input within the dropdown.  

```text

       - **Status Filters:** A group of three \<Button variant="outline"\>

```text
     components
     ("Running", "Stopped", "Error"). These function as multi-select toggles.
     Each
     should have a small, colored circle icon indicating the status.  

```text

       - **Bulk Actions:** Standard \<Button\> components for "Run All Filtered"

```text
     and
     "Stop All Filtered". These buttons should be disabled by default and
     only
     become active when the data grid is not empty.  

```text

     - **Data Grid:**  
       - **Component:** The primary data grid will be built using the shadcn

```text
     \<Table\> component.  

```text

       - **Columns (Default View):** To maintain simplicity, the default view

```text
     will
     show: Automation Name, Client, Status, Last Run, and Actions.  

```text

       - **Customizable Columns:** The grid should be designed to allow for

```text
     customizable columns in the future (e.g., showing/hiding Avg Duration
     or
     other metadata).  

```text

       - **Actions Column:** This column will contain two \<Button

```text
     variant="ghost"
     size="icon"\> buttons for individual "Run" and "Stop" actions, using
     icons
     like \<PlayCircle\> and \<PauseCircle\>.  

```text

     - **Empty State:**  
       - When no automations exist for a user, or when filters return no

```text
     results,
     the grid area will be replaced with a helpful empty state component.  

```text

       - This component should contain a relevant icon, a clear headline (e.g.,

```text
     "No
     Automations Found"), and a helpful subtext with a call to action
     (e.g., "Try
     adjusting your filters or learn how to add your first automation.").  

```text

- **Responsive Behavior:**  
  - **Tablet:** The sidebar will collapse by default to show only icons. The

```text
toolbar layout will adapt to prevent wrapping.  

```text

- **Mobile:** The data grid will transform into a single-column list of

```text
\<Card\>
components. Each card will represent one automation and display its most
critical
information and action buttons. The toolbar filters will collapse into a
single
"Filters" button that opens a modal or drawer.

```text

## **Component Library / Design System**

### **Design System Approach**

Our design system approach is to use **shadcn/ui** as our foundational component
library. We will not be building a design system from scratch. Instead, we will
compose our UI by using the pre-built, accessible components provided by
shadcn/ui
and styling them with Tailwind CSS to match our brand guidelines. This approach
accelerates development while ensuring a high-quality, consistent user
experience.

### **Core Components**

Below are the primary shadcn/ui components that will form the foundation of our
MVP interface.

#### **Button**

- **Purpose:** Primary interaction element for all user actions (e.g., Run,
  Stop,
  Filter).  
- **Variants to be used:** Default (for primary actions), Destructive, Outline
  (for filters), Ghost (for sidebar navigation and icon buttons).  
- **States:** Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading.

#### **Table**

- **Purpose:** To display the main data grid of automations.  
- **Structure:** We will use the full suite of table components: \<Table\>,
  \<TableHeader\>, \<TableRow\>, \<TableHead\>, \<TableBody\>, \<TableCell\>.  
- **States:** Rows will have a hover state for visual feedback.

#### **Input**

- **Purpose:** Used for the primary search field in the toolbar.  
- **States:** Default, Focus, Disabled.

#### **Select**

- **Purpose:** Used for the "Client" filter dropdown in the toolbar.  
- **States:** Open, Closed, Hover, Disabled.

#### **Card**

- **Purpose:** Used for the responsive mobile view, where each card will
  represent
  a single automation.  
- **Structure:** We will use \<Card\>, \<CardHeader\>, \<CardContent\>, and
  \<CardFooter\> to structure the information clearly on small screens.

#### **Dialog**

- **Purpose:** Crucial for displaying confirmation messages before a user
  performs
  a potentially destructive action (e.g., "Run All Filtered").  
- **States:** Open, Closed.

#### **Toast**

- **Purpose:** For displaying non-intrusive feedback to the user, such as the
  success/failure summary report after a bulk action is completed.  
- **Variants:** Default (for success), Destructive (for errors).

## **Branding & Style Guide**

This style guide is the single source of truth for the application's visual
identity.

### **Visual Identity**

No external brand guidelines have been provided; therefore, this document will
serve as the primary style guide for the project.

### **Color Palette**

| Color Type | Hex Code | Usage | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Background (Dark)** | gradient \#0a0b1f → \#002bff | Main background for dark mode. | Design System |
| **Background (Light)** | \#ffffff | Main background for light mode. | Design System |
| **Text (Dark)** | \#ffffff | Default text color for dark mode. | Design System |
| **Text (Light)** | \#000000 | Default text color for light mode. | Design System |
| **Accent Blue** | gradient \#003cff → \#0066ff | Used for primary buttons, links, and highlights. | Design System |
| **Success / Running** | \#22c55e | Used for success states and "Running" badges. | Design System |
| **Error / Danger** | \#ef4444 | Used for error states, destructive actions, and "Error" badges. | Design System |
| **Warning** | \#FAAD14 | Used for non-critical warnings or cautionary states. | Design System |
| **Neutral / Stopped** | \#9ca3af | Used for secondary text and "Stopped" badges. | Design System |
| **Border (Light)** | \#e5e7eb | Default border color in light mode. | Design System |
| **Border (Dark)** | \#374151 | Default border color in dark mode. | Design System |

### **Typography**

- **Font Family:** To ensure a clean, modern, and highly readable interface,
  it is
  proposed to use a standard system font stack (e.g., \-apple-system,
  BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif). This
  provides excellent performance and a native feel across all operating
  systems.
- **Type Scale:** A standard typographic scale will be used to maintain visual
  hierarchy. (e.g., H1: 30px, H2: 24px, H3: 20px, Body: 16px).

### **Iconography**

- **Icon Library:** We will use the **lucide-react** icon library. It is
  designed
  to be simple, consistent, and works seamlessly with shadcn/ui and React.  
- **Usage Guidelines:** Icons should always be used with a clear purpose and
  paired with a text label where appropriate to ensure accessibility.

### **Spacing & Layout**

- **Grid System:** The layout will be based on an **8-point grid system**. All
  spacing (padding, margins, gaps) and component sizes should be in multiples of
  8px (e.g., 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px) to ensure consistent and harmonious layouts.

## **Accessibility Requirements**

### **Compliance Target**

The application will be designed and developed to meet the **Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at the Level AA** standard.

### **Key Requirements**

#### **Visual**

- **Color Contrast:** All text must meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1
  against its background to ensure readability.  
- **Focus Indicators:** All interactive elements (links, buttons, inputs) must
  have a clear and highly visible focus state when navigated to via a keyboard.
- **Text Sizing:** The application must support browser zoom up to 200% without
  loss of content or functionality, allowing users to resize text to their
  needs.

#### **Interaction**

- **Keyboard Navigation:** The entire application must be navigable and operable
  using only a keyboard. The tab order for interactive elements must be logical
  and
  intuitive.  
- **Screen Reader Support:** All elements, especially controls and dynamic
  content, must be properly labeled with descriptive text for screen readers.
  Appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles will be used
  where
  necessary.  
- **Touch Targets:** All clickable and tappable elements must have a minimum
  target size of 44x44 CSS pixels to be easily and accurately used on touch
  devices.

#### **Content**

- **Alternative Text:** All meaningful images and icons must have descriptive
  alternative (alt) text. Elements that are purely decorative should have an
  empty
  alt attribute (alt="").  
- **Heading Structure:** Pages must use a logical and semantic heading structure
  (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to define the document outline for assistive
  technologies.
- **Form Labels:** All form inputs (\<Input\>, \<Select\>, etc.) must have a
  programmatically associated \<label\> for clarity.

### **Testing Strategy**

Accessibility and functionality will be a continuous effort, validated through a
three-layered strategy:

1. **Static Analysis:** We will use eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y to automatically
   check
   for accessibility issues directly in the code editor during development.  
2. **Component Testing:** We will use **React Testing Library** to test
   individual
   components. As part of this process, we will integrate **jest-axe** to
   programmatically check for accessibility violations in every component test.
3. **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** We will use **Playwright** to test critical
   user
   flows from end-to-end. These tests will also include automated accessibility
   checks on the fully rendered pages to catch any integration issues.

## **Responsiveness Strategy**

### **Breakpoints**

We will use a standard set of breakpoints, consistent with modern CSS frameworks
like Tailwind CSS, to manage layout changes across devices.

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Target Devices |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Mobile** | (default) | Phones |
| **Tablet** | 768px | Tablets |
| **Desktop** | 1024px | Laptops, Desktops |
| **Wide** | 1280px | Large Desktop Monitors |

### **Adaptation Patterns**

- **Global Layout:** The core layout will adapt from a single column on mobile
  to
  the sidebar \+ content view on tablet and desktop screens.  
- **Navigation:** On mobile, the primary sidebar will be hidden by default and
  activated via a standard "hamburger" menu icon. On tablet and desktop, it will
  be
  persistently visible.  
- **Grid-to-Card Transformation:** This is the most critical adaptation. On
  mobile
  screens (\< 768px), the data \<Table\> will be replaced by a single-column
  list of
  \<Card\> components. Each card will represent one automation and display its
  most
  essential information and action buttons to ensure readability and prevent
  horizontal scrolling.  
- **Toolbar:** On mobile screens, the toolbar's filter controls will collapse
  into
  a more compact layout, likely behind a single "Filters" button that opens a
  modal
  or drawer.  
- **Interactions:** Hover-based interactions will be reserved for desktop users.
  All interactive elements will be designed with touch-friendly target sizes
  (minimum 44x44px) for tablet and mobile.

## **Animation & Micro-interactions**

### **Motion Principles**

All animations and transitions should be purposeful, performant, consistent, and accessible.

1. **Purposeful Motion:** Animation will be used to guide the user's attention,
   provide feedback on actions, and make state transitions feel smooth and natural.  
2. **Responsive and Performant:** All animations must be lightweight, favoring
   CSS transitions to ensure the interface never feels sluggish.  
3. **Subtle & Professional:** Motion will be subtle and professional,
   reinforcing the "sleek and efficient" feel while avoiding distracting effects.
   A standard duration of 0.2s \- 0.3s with an ease-in-out timing function will be
   used.  
4. **Accessible by Default:** All motion must respect the user's device settings.
   Non-essential animations will be disabled for users who have enabled the
   prefers-reduced-motion accessibility feature.

### **Technology**

- **Primary Animation Engine:** Animations will primarily be handled by the
  built-in transitions of **shadcn/ui** and **Tailwind CSS** to ensure consistency
  and performance.  
- **Complex Animations:** For any future complex or orchestrated animations, the
  **Framer Motion** library is recommended due to its excellent integration with
  React and its focus on accessibility.

### **Justification & Critical Challenge**

Before we commit to any animation, we must ask: **"Does this animation provide
essential feedback and improve usability, or is it purely decorative?"** Every
animation has a potential performance and cognitive cost.

- **State Transitions (Badge Colors):**  
  - _Animation:_ The background color of a status badge smoothly fades between states.  
  - _Justification:_ **Essential.** This provides clear, non-jarring visual

```text
feedback that the state has changed.  

```text

- **Sidebar Collapse/Expand:**  
  - _Animation:_ The sidebar animates its width smoothly when toggled.  
  - _Justification:_ **Essential.** This visually connects the collapsed and

```text
expanded states, preventing a jarring layout shift.  

```text

- **Modal Dialogs:**  
  - _Animation:_ Confirmation dialogs fade in and scale up slightly when appearing.  
  - _Refinement:_ The animation should be extremely fast (\< 0.2s) to feel

```text
responsive, not sluggish.  

```text

- **Button & Filter Chip Feedback:**  
  - _Animation:_ Subtle transitions on hover and a "press" effect when clicked.  
  - _Justification:_ **Essential.** This is standard, expected feedback for

```text
interactive elements.

```text

## **Performance Considerations**

### **Performance Goals (Refined)**

To provide a professional, high-quality user experience, we will measure
performance against **Google's Core Web Vitals**. Our targets are:

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** The main content of the dashboard should
  render in under **2.5 seconds**.  
- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP):** All user interactions (clicks, types,
  etc.) must provide visual feedback in under **200ms**.  
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** The layout should be stable during and
  after loading, with a score below **0.1**.  
- **Animation FPS:** All animations must maintain a consistent **60 frames per
  second (FPS)**.

### **Design & Development Strategies (Expanded)**

To achieve these goals, the following strategies will be implemented:

- **Optimistic UI Updates:** For actions like running or stopping an automation,
  the UI will update the status immediately to a "Triggered..." state while the
  backend request is being processed.  
- **Data Grid Virtualization:** To ensure the grid remains fast with 1,000+
  automations, it will be built using a virtualization library like **TanStack
  Virtual**.  
- **Skeleton Loaders:** When fetching initial data for the grid, the UI will
  display a "skeleton" version of the table. This improves the _perceived
  performance_ and prevents layout shifts.  
- **Code Splitting by Route:** The application will be broken into smaller
  JavaScript chunks using dynamic import() statements. Users will only download
  the code for the screen they are currently viewing.  
- **Asset Optimization:** All static assets like logos and icons will be
  optimized and served in modern, lightweight formats (e.g., SVG).

### **Performance Risks & Mitigations**

- **Risk: Real-time Subscription Overhead**  
  - **Issue:** Maintaining a large number of simultaneous real-time subscriptions

```text
can consume significant client-side resources and potentially make the UI
sluggish.  

```text

- **Mitigation:** The development team must benchmark this feature. If

```text
performance degrades, we will consider a fallback strategy, such as a manual
"Refresh" button or a less frequent polling interval.  

```text

- **Risk: Heavy Component Library Impact**  
  - **Issue:** The use of rich components can increase the initial JavaScript

```text
bundle size, negatively affecting our LCP goal.  

```text

- **Mitigation:** We will implement aggressive code-splitting and lazy-load

```text
components that are not immediately visible. A bundle analyzer tool will be
used to monitor bundle sizes.  

```text

- **Risk: Customizable Grid Re-Renders**  
  - **Issue:** Implementing column resizing and reordering can cause performance

```text
issues due to frequent re-rendering of large amounts of data.  

```text

- **Mitigation:** This feature must be implemented using performance-conscious

```text
techniques, such as React's memoization APIs (React.memo), to prevent
unnecessary re-renders.

```text

## **Next Steps**

With this UI/UX Specification complete, we have a comprehensive blueprint for the
application's frontend. The immediate actions are:
