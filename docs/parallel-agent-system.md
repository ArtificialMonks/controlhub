# Parallel Agent Execution System

A comprehensive solution for true parallel agent execution in Claude Code, enabling terminal independence and background processing while maintaining full compatibility with the existing `/agents` system.

## Problem Solved

The default Claude Code `Task` tool and `/agents` command are **synchronous and blocking**, meaning:

- When an agent is deployed, it takes over the main terminal session
- All user input is blocked until the agent completes
- No ability to run multiple agents simultaneously
- Completely defeats the purpose of independent agent workers

## Solution Overview

This system provides **true parallel execution** with:

‚úÖ **Terminal Independence** - Your terminal stays responsive while agents work  
‚úÖ **Background Processing** - Agents run in separate processes  
‚úÖ **Real-time Monitoring** - Progress updates without blocking input  
‚úÖ **Parallel Execution** - Run multiple agents simultaneously  
‚úÖ **Full Compatibility** - Works with existing `/agents` system  
‚úÖ **Proper Lifecycle Management** - Start, monitor, terminate, and cleanup agents

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AgentDispatcher** (`scripts/agent-dispatcher.ts`)
   - Manages agent processes and lifecycle
   - Provides status monitoring and logging
   - Handles process termination and cleanup

2. **ParallelAgentWrapper** (`scripts/parallel-agent-wrapper.ts`)
   - User-friendly interface for agent deployment
   - Integrates with Claude Code's native agent system
   - Provides detailed status reporting and monitoring

3. **NPM Scripts Integration**
   - Convenient commands for all agent operations
   - Seamless integration with existing workflow

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# List available agents
npm run agent:list

# Deploy an agent in background (non-blocking)
npm run agent:deploy markdown-qa-enforcer "Fix violations" "Scan and fix all markdown files"

# Check status of all agents
npm run agent:status

# Check specific agent status
npm run agent:status <agent-id>

# Terminate a running agent
npm run agent:terminate <agent-id>

# Clean up completed agents
npm run agent:cleanup
```

### Key Benefits

#### Before (Blocking Execution)
```bash
# This BLOCKS your terminal until completion
/agents markdown-qa-enforcer

# You cannot do anything else while agent runs
# Terminal is completely unresponsive
# No progress updates
# Cannot run multiple agents
```

#### After (Parallel Execution)
```bash
# Deploy agent - terminal immediately returns control
npm run agent:deploy markdown-qa-enforcer "Fix violations" "Scan all files"

# Your terminal is FREE! You can continue working
# Agent runs independently in background
# Real-time progress updates
# Deploy multiple agents simultaneously
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Deploy with Custom Options

```typescript
// Using the API directly
import ParallelAgentWrapper from './scripts/parallel-agent-wrapper';

const wrapper = new ParallelAgentWrapper();

const agentId = await wrapper.deployAgentParallel(
  'markdown-qa-enforcer',
  'Comprehensive markdown quality assurance scan',
  {
    description: 'Full codebase markdown validation',
    priority: 'high',
    timeout: 300000 // 5 minutes
  }
);
```

#### Event-Driven Monitoring

```typescript
import AgentDispatcher from './scripts/agent-dispatcher';

const dispatcher = new AgentDispatcher();

dispatcher.on('agentStarted', (agentId, status) => {
  console.log(`Agent ${status.name} started`);
});

dispatcher.on('agentCompleted', (agentId, status) => {
  console.log(`Agent ${status.name} completed successfully`);
});

dispatcher.on('agentProgress', (agentId, progress) => {
  console.log(`Progress: ${progress}`);
});
```

## Command Reference

### NPM Scripts

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `npm run agent:list` | List all available agents | - |
| `npm run agent:deploy <name> "<desc>" "<prompt>"` | Deploy agent in background | `npm run agent:deploy markdown-qa-enforcer "Fix violations" "Scan all files"` |
| `npm run agent:status [id]` | Check agent status | `npm run agent:status` or `npm run agent:status agent-123` |
| `npm run agent:terminate <id>` | Stop running agent | `npm run agent:terminate agent-123` |

### Direct CLI Usage

```bash
# Using the wrapper directly
tsx scripts/parallel-agent-wrapper.ts deploy markdown-qa-enforcer "Description" "Prompt"
tsx scripts/parallel-agent-wrapper.ts status
tsx scripts/parallel-agent-wrapper.ts list

# Using the dispatcher directly
tsx scripts/agent-dispatcher.ts deploy markdown-qa-enforcer "Description" "Prompt"
tsx scripts/agent-dispatcher.ts status

## Agent Status States

| State | Description | Icon |
|-------|-------------|------|
| `pending` | Agent queued but not started | ‚è≥ |
| `running` | Agent actively processing | üîÑ |
| `completed` | Agent finished successfully | ‚úÖ |
| `failed` | Agent encountered an error | ‚ùå |
| `terminated` | Agent was manually stopped | üõë |

## Monitoring and Logging

### Status Persistence

Agent status is automatically saved to:
```
logs/agent-dispatcher.json
```

This ensures status persistence across system restarts (though running agents are lost).

### Real-time Updates

The system provides real-time progress updates without blocking your terminal:

```bash
üöÄ Agent 'markdown-qa-enforcer' started (markdown-qa-enforcer-1691234567890-abc123)
üìä Monitor with: npm run agent:status markdown-qa-enforcer-1691234567890-abc123
‚ö° Agent markdown-qa-enforcer-1691234567890-abc123: Processing markdown files...
‚ö° Agent markdown-qa-enforcer-1691234567890-abc123: Fixed 15 violations in /docs/
‚úÖ Agent 'markdown-qa-enforcer' completed in 2m 34s
```

### Detailed Status Information

```bash
$ npm run agent:status markdown-qa-enforcer-1691234567890-abc123

‚úÖ Agent Status Details:
   Name: markdown-qa-enforcer
   ID: markdown-qa-enforcer-1691234567890-abc123
   Status: completed
   Started: 2024-08-04T16:30:00.000Z
   Duration: 2m 34s
   Process ID: 12345
   Progress: Completed processing 28 files

üìÑ Agent Result:
{
  "filesProcessed": 28,
  "violationsFixed": 73,
  "remainingViolations": 0,
  "status": "success"
}
```

## Integration with A.V.A.R.I.C.E. Protocol

The parallel agent system fully integrates with the A.V.A.R.I.C.E. Protocol's "colony queen" architecture:

- **Colony Queen** deploys multiple worker agents simultaneously
- **Workers** operate independently in parallel
- **Communication** via event system and status monitoring
- **Coordination** through shared status and logging systems
- **Lifecycle Management** for proper resource cleanup

### Colony-Style Deployment

```bash
# Deploy multiple agents simultaneously (true parallel execution)
npm run agent:deploy markdown-qa-enforcer "QA Worker" "Fix markdown violations" &
npm run agent:deploy security-analyzer "Security Worker" "Scan for vulnerabilities" &
npm run agent:deploy performance-optimizer "Performance Worker" "Optimize code performance" &

# All agents work simultaneously without blocking
# Terminal remains responsive for continued work
# Monitor all agents: npm run agent:status
```

## Compatibility

### Existing System Compatibility

- **Full compatibility** with existing `.claude/agents/*.md` files
- **Seamless integration** with Claude Code's native `/agents` command
- **No breaking changes** to existing workflows
- **Backward compatible** - traditional `/agents` still works

### Migration Path

```bash
# Old way (blocking)
/agents markdown-qa-enforcer

# New way (non-blocking)
npm run agent:deploy markdown-qa-enforcer "Description" "Same prompt you used before"

# Both work! Choose based on your needs:
# - Use /agents for simple, one-off tasks where blocking is acceptable
# - Use npm run agent:deploy for complex, long-running, or parallel workflows
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent not found**
   ```bash
   # Check available agents
   npm run agent:list
   
   # Ensure agent exists in .claude/agents/ or ~/.claude/agents/
   ```

2. **Agent stuck in running state**
   ```bash
   # Check if process is actually running
   npm run agent:status <agent-id>
   
   # Force terminate if needed
   npm run agent:terminate <agent-id>
   ```

3. **Permission issues**
   ```bash
   # Ensure scripts are executable
   chmod +x scripts/agent-dispatcher.ts
   chmod +x scripts/parallel-agent-wrapper.ts
   ```

### Debugging

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:

```bash
# Set environment variable for verbose output
DEBUG=agent-dispatcher npm run agent:deploy <agent-name> "<desc>" "<prompt>"
```

### Recovery

Clean up system state if needed:

```bash
# Remove all completed/failed agents from memory
npm run agent:cleanup

# Remove log files to reset state
rm -f logs/agent-dispatcher.json
```

## Performance

### Resource Usage

- **Minimal overhead** - agents run as child processes
- **Memory efficient** - status tracking uses minimal memory
- **CPU optimized** - no polling, event-driven updates
- **Storage efficient** - compact JSON logging

### Scalability

- **Concurrent agents** - no hard limit (system dependent)
- **Process isolation** - agents cannot interfere with each other
- **Resource cleanup** - automatic cleanup of completed agents
- **Status persistence** - maintains state across restarts

## Security

### Process Isolation

- Each agent runs in a separate process
- No shared memory between agents
- Process-level security isolation
- Proper cleanup prevents resource leaks

### Permission Model

- Agents inherit Claude Code's permission system
- No additional privileges required
- Secure process spawning
- No elevated permissions needed

## Development

### Extending the System

Add new features by:

1. **Extending AgentDispatcher** for new process management features
2. **Extending ParallelAgentWrapper** for new user interface features
3. **Adding new event types** for enhanced monitoring
4. **Creating custom agent templates** with specific behaviors

### Contributing

Follow the A.V.A.R.I.C.E. Protocol development standards:

- TypeScript strict mode compliance
