# A.V.A.R.I.C.E. Protocol Rules & Guidelines

## **CRITICAL PROHIBITIONS**

### **STRICTLY PROHIBITED TECHNOLOGIES**

- **JAVASCRIPT CREATION**: Strictly prohibited to create, code, and use JavaScript in any form
- **THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS**: Creating testing frameworks, validation systems, or verification tools WITHOUT executing
them is prohibited
- **PARTIAL COMPLETION**: "Mostly working," "good enough," or partial completion status is strictly prohibited
- **ASSUMPTION-BASED WORK**: Never speculate or make assumptions - verify every action, claim, and connection

## **MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOLS**

### **TEST EXECUTION REQUIREMENT**

- **EXECUTION MANDATE**: Every test, validation, or verification activity must be ACTUALLY EXECUTED with documented
results
- **EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT**: Provide concrete proof including logs, metrics, screenshots, or other artifacts
- **THEORETICAL PROHIBITION**: Theoretical frameworks without execution evidence are incomplete
- **PROOF REQUIREMENT**: Claims of "tests created" or "validation implemented" are meaningless without concrete
execution evidence

### **IMMEDIATE ISSUE RESOLUTION PROTOCOL**
